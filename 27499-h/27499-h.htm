<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p>It is proposed that this shall be the first of a
series of little volumes in which shall be presented
in a handy form selections from the
Folk-lore and legends of various countries. It
has been well said that "the legendary history
of a nation is the recital of the elements that
formed the character of that nation; it contains
the first rude attempts to explain natural
phenomena, the traditions of its early history,
and the moral principles popularly adopted as
the rules for reward and punishment; and
generally the legends of a people may be
regarded as embodying the popular habits of
thought and popular motives of action." The
following legends of Germany cannot, we think,
fail to interest those who read them. Some of
the stories are invested with a charming simplicity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
of thought which cannot but excite admiration.
Others are of a weird, fantastic
character fitted to a land of romantic natural
features, of broad river, mountain, and deep
forest. The humorous, the pathetic, the terrible,
all find place in the German folk-tales, and it
would be difficult to rise from their perusal
without having received both amusement and
instruction. The general lesson they convey is
the sure punishment of vice and the reward
of virtue; some way or another the villain
always meets with his desert. In future volumes
we shall deal with the legends of other countries,
hoping that the public will bear us company
in our excursions.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The value of national stories and legends has in
late years become very widely recognised. Folk-lore
has recently received a large amount of attention,
and the thought and labour bestowed upon
the subject have been rewarded by results which
prove that its investigators have entered upon no
unfruitful, however long neglected, field.</p>

<p>This book, and its successors in the series which
it is proposed to issue, may come into the hands of
some who, having little opportunity afforded them
to consider how the legends and tales it contains
may be of the value we claim for them, may be
glad to have the "case" for legends and national
stories presented to them in a few words.</p>

<p>The peasant's tale, the story preserved through
centuries on the lips of old wives, the narrative
which has come down to us having done duty as a
source of amusement in the fireside groups of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg&nbsp;x]</a></span>
preceding generations, may seem to some to afford
slight matter for reflection, and may even appear
so grotesque in its incidents as to be fitted only to
excite a smile of wonder at the simplicity of those
among whom such stories could obtain reception,
and surprise at the fantastic imagination in which
such tales could find their origin. Modern thought
has, however, been busy asking itself what is the
meaning of these stories, and it has done much to
supply itself with an answer. This, at least, it has
done: it has discovered that these legends and tales,
which so many have been inclined to cast aside as
worthless, are of a singular value, as throwing a
light which little else can afford upon the mind of
primitive man. At first the collection of national
stories was undertaken merely for the purpose of
affording amusement. Folk-tales were diverting, so
they found their way into print, and were issued
as curious literary matter fitted to supply diversion
for a vacant hour. Many of the tales are very
beautiful, and their mere literary merit sufficed to
make them sought for. But legendary lore was
soon observed to possess much more value than
could attach to its merely amusing features. It
was obvious that in these legends were preserved
the fragments of the beliefs of the ancient folk.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</a></span>
"The mythology of one period," remarked Sir
Walter Scott, "would appear to pass into the
romance of the next century, and that into the
nursery tale of the subsequent ages." "Fiction,"
said Sir John Malcolm, "resolves itself into its
primitive elements, as, by the slow and unceasing
action of the wind and rain, the solid granite is
crumbled into sand. The creations embodied by
the vivid imagination of man in the childhood of
his race incorporate themselves in his fond and
mistaken faith. Sanctity is given to his daydreams
by the altar of the idol. Then, perhaps,
they acquire a deceitful truth from the genius
of the bard. Blended with the mortal hero,
the aspect of the god glances through the visor
of the helmet, or adds a holy dignity to the
royal crown. Poetry borrows its ornaments from
the lessons of the priests. The ancient god of
strength of the Teutons, throned in his chariot
of the stars, the Northern Wain, invested the
Emperor of the Franks and the paladins who
surrounded him with superhuman might. And
the same constellation, darting down its rays
upon the head of the long-lost Arthur, has
given to the monarch of the Britons the veneration
which once belonged to the son of 'Uthry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</a></span>
Bendragon,' 'Thunder, the supreme leader,' and
'Eygyr, the generating power.' Time rolls on;
faith lessens; the flocks are led to graze within
the rocky circle of the giants, even the bones
of the warriors moulder into dust; the lay is
no longer heard; and the fable, reduced again
to its original simplicity and nudity, becomes
the fitting source of pastime to the untutored
peasant and the listening child. Hence we may
yet trace no small proportion of mystic and
romantic lore in the tales which gladden the
cottage fireside, or, century after century, soothe
the infant to its slumbers." The works of the
brothers Grimm, the appearance of the <i>Kinder-&nbsp;und Haus-M&auml;hrchen</i>,
in 1812, and of the <i>Deutsche
Mythologie</i>, in 1835, threw a new light on the
importance of national tales, and awoke the
spirit of scientific comparison which has made
the study of Folk-lore productive of such valuable
results.</p>


<p>With regard to the diffusion of national stories,
it is remarkable that we find substantially identical
narratives flourishing in the most widely separated
countries, and this fact has given rise to several
explanatory theories, none of which seems perfectly
satisfactory. The philological discovery of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</a></span>
original unity of all the Aryan races may account
for the possession by the Aryan peoples of similar
stories. It may be, as Sir George Cox suggests, a
common inheritance of such tales as were current
when the Aryans "still lived as a single people."
We find, however, that these tales are also current
among people whom, accepting this theory, we
should least expect to find possessing them, and so
the wide diffusion of the stories yet remains unsatisfactorily
accounted for. Identity of imagination,
inheritance, transmission, may each have played
its part.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the tales much debate has
arisen. It is obvious from the nature of the incidents
of many of them that they could only have
originated in a most primitive state of man.
"Early man," says Sir George Cox, "had life,
and therefore all things must have life also. The
sun, the moon, the stars, the ground on which he
trod, the clouds, storms, lightnings were all living
beings; could he help thinking that, like himself,
they were all conscious beings also?" Such, according
to this authority, was the origin of primary
myths, secondary and tertiary myths arising in the
course of time from the gradual misunderstanding
of phrases applied by primitive man to personified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</a></span>
objects. According to Professor Max M&uuml;ller, animism,
or the investing all things with life, springs not
in the first place from man's thought, but from the
language in which he clothes it. Man, he says,
found himself speaking of all things in words having
"a termination expressive of gender, and this
naturally produced in the mind the corresponding
idea of sex." He thus came to invest all objects
with "something of an individual, active, sexual,
and at last personal character." However hard it
may be to discover the reason for the origin of the
tendency to animism, the fact is certain that the
tendency is to be found generally existing among
savage peoples, and it would seem that we must
accept the national stories which have come down
to us embodying this tendency in grotesque incidents
as relics handed down from the savage days
of the people with whom the tales originated, as the
expression of portions of their thought when they
had as yet only attained to such a degree of
civilisation as exists among savages of the present
day.</p>

<p>Strange and grotesque as some of the national
stories are, they may be regarded as embodying
the fragments of some of man's most primitive
beliefs; and recognising this, it will be impossible to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg&nbsp;xv]</a></span>
dismiss the folk-tale as unworthy of careful consideration,
nor may it be regarded as unfitted to
afford us, if studied aright, very much more than
merely such amusement as may be derived from its
quaint incident and grotesque plot.</p>

<h2>GAFFER DEATH.</h2>


<p>There was once a poor man who had twelve children,
and he was obliged to labour day and night
that he might earn food for them. When at length,
as it so happened, a thirteenth came into the world,
the poor man did not know how to help himself,
so he ran out into the highway, determined to
ask the first person he met to be godfather to the
boy.</p>

<p>There came stalking up to him Death, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take me for a godfather."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"I am Death, who makes all equal," replied the
stranger.</p>

<p>Then said the man&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are one of the right sort: you seize on rich
and poor without distinction; you shall be the child's
godfather."</p>

<p>Death answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will make the boy rich and renowned throughout
the world, for he who has me for a friend can
want nothing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
Said the man&mdash;</p>

<p>"Next Sunday will he be christened, mind and
come at the right time."</p>

<p>Death accordingly appeared as he had promised,
and stood godfather to the child.</p>

<p>When the boy grew up his godfather came to
him one day, and took him into a wood, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now shall you have your godfather's present. I
will make a most famous physician of you. Whenever
you are called to a sick person, I will take care
and show myself to you. If I stand at the foot of
the bed, say boldly, 'I will soon restore you to
health,' and give the patient a little herb that I will
point out to you, and he will soon be well. If,
however, I stand at the head of the sick person, he
is mine; then say, 'All help is useless; he must
soon die.'"</p>

<p>Then Death showed him the little herb, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take heed that you never use it in opposition
to my will."</p>

<p>It was not long before the young fellow was the
most celebrated physician in the whole world.</p>

<p>"The moment he sees a person," said every one,
"he knows whether or not he'll recover."</p>

<p>Accordingly he was soon in great request. People
came from far and near to consult him, and they
gave him whatever he required, so that he made an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
immense fortune. Now, it so happened that the
king was taken ill, and the physician was called
upon to say whether he must die. As he went up
to the bed he saw Death standing at the sick
man's head, so that there was no chance of his
recovery. The physician thought, however, that if
he outwitted Death, he would not, perhaps, be much
offended, seeing that he was his godfather, so he
caught hold of the king and turned him round, so
that by that means Death was standing at his feet.
Then he gave him some of the herb, and the king
recovered, and was once more well. Death came
up to the physician with a very angry and gloomy
countenance, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will forgive you this time what you have done,
because I am your godfather, but if you ever venture
to betray me again, you must take the consequences."</p>

<p>Soon after this the king's daughter fell sick, and
nobody could cure her. The old king wept night
and day, until his eyes were blinded, and at last
he proclaimed that whosoever rescued her from
Death should be rewarded by marrying her and
inheriting his throne. The physician came, but
Death was standing at the head of the princess.
When the physician saw the beauty of the king's
daughter, and thought of the promises that the king
had made, he forgot all the warnings he had received,
and, although Death frowned heavily all the while,
he turned the patient so that Death stood at her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
feet, and gave her some of the herb, so that he once
more put life into her veins.</p>

<p>When Death saw that he was a second time
cheated out of his property, he stepped up to the
physician, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, follow me."</p>

<p>He laid hold of him with his icy cold hand, and
led him into a subterranean cave, in which there
were thousands and thousands of burning candles,
ranged in innumerable rows. Some were whole,
some half burnt out, some nearly consumed. Every
instant some went out, and fresh ones were lighted,
so that the little flames seemed perpetually hopping
about.</p>

<p>"Behold," said Death, "the life-candles of mankind.
The large ones belong to children, those half
consumed to middle-aged people, the little ones to
the aged. Yet children and young people have
oftentimes but a little candle, and when that is
burnt out, their life is at an end, and they are mine."</p>

<p>The physician said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Show me my candle."</p>

<p>Then Death pointed out a very little candle-end,
which was glimmering in the socket, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Behold!"</p>

<p>Then the physician said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O dearest godfather, light me up a new one,
that I may first enjoy my life, be king, and husband
of the beautiful princess."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
"I cannot do so," said Death; "one must burn out
before I can light up another."</p>

<p>"Place the old one then upon a new one, that
that may burn on when this is at an end," said the
physician.</p>

<p>Death pretended that he would comply with this
wish, and reached a large candle, but to revenge
himself, purposely failed in putting it up, and the
little piece fell and was extinguished. The physician
sank with it, so he himself fell into the hands of
Death.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF PARACELSUS.</h2>


<p>It once happened that Paracelsus was walking
through a forest, when he heard a voice calling to
him by name. He looked around, and at length
discovered that it proceeded from a fir-tree, in the
trunk of which there was a spirit enclosed by a
small stopper, sealed with three crosses.</p>

<p>The spirit begged of Paracelsus to set him free.
This he readily promised, on condition that the
spirit should bestow upon him a medicine capable
of healing all diseases, and a tincture which would
turn everything it touched to gold. The spirit
acceded to his request, whereupon Paracelsus took
his penknife, and succeeded, after some trouble, in
getting out the stopper. A loathsome black spider
crept forth, which ran down the trunk of the tree.
Scarcely had it reached the ground before it was
changed, and became, as if rising from the earth, a
tall haggard man, with squinting red eyes, wrapped
in a scarlet mantle.</p>

<p>He led Paracelsus to a high, overhanging, craggy
mount, and with a hazel twig, which he had broken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
off by the way, he smote the rock, which, splitting
with a crash at the blow, divided itself in twain,
and the spirit disappeared within it. He, however,
soon returned with two small phials, which he
handed to Paracelsus&mdash;a yellow one, containing the
tincture which turned all it touched to gold, and
a white one, holding the medicine which healed all
diseases. He then smote the rock a second time,
and thereupon it instantly closed again.</p>

<p>Both now set forth on their return, the spirit
directing his course towards Innspr&uuml;ck, to seize
upon the magician who had banished him from that
city. Now Paracelsus trembled for the consequences
which his releasing the Evil One would
entail upon him who had conjured him into the
tree, and bethought how he might rescue him.
When they arrived once more at the fir-tree, he
asked the spirit if he could possibly transform himself
again into a spider, and let him see him creep
into the hole. The spirit said that it was not only
possible, but that he would be most happy to make
such a display of his art for the gratification of his
deliverer.</p>

<p>Accordingly he once more assumed the form
of a spider, and crept again into the well-known
crevice. When he had done so, Paracelsus, who
had kept the stopper all ready in his hand for the
purpose, clapped it as quick as lightning into the hole,
hammered it in firmly with a stone, and with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
knife made three fresh crosses upon it. The spirit,
mad with rage, shook the fir-tree as though with a
whirlwind, that he might drive out the stopper
which Paracelsus had thrust in, but his fury was of
no avail. It held fast, and left him there with
little hope of escape, for, on account of the great
drifts of snow from the mountains, the forest will
never be cut down, and, although he should call
night and day, nobody in that neighbourhood ever
ventures near the spot.</p>

<p>Paracelsus, however, found that the phials were
such as he had demanded, and it was by their
means that he afterwards became such a celebrated
and distinguished man.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>"Master, my time is up; I should like to go home
and see my mother, so give me my wages."</p>

<p>And the master said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have been a faithful and good servant, so
your pay shall be handsome."</p>

<p>Then he gave him a piece of silver that was as big
as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief,
put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his
shoulder, and jogged off homewards. As he went
lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man
came in sight, trotting along gaily on a capital
horse.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hans aloud, "what a fine thing it is
to ride on horseback! There he sits as if he were
at home in his chair. He trips against no stones,
spares his shoes, and yet gets on he hardly knows
how."</p>

<p>The horseman heard this, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Hans, why do you go on foot, then?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
"Ah!" said he, "I have this load to carry; to be
sure, it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can't hold
up my head, and it hurts my shoulder sadly."</p>

<p>"What do you say to changing?" said the horseman.
"I will give you my horse, and you shall
give me the silver."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said Hans, "but I tell you
one thing: you will have a weary task to drag it
along."</p>

<p>The horseman got off, took the silver, helped
Hans up, gave him the bridle into his hand, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you want to go very fast, you must smack
your lips loud and cry, 'Jip.'"</p>

<p>Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, and
rode merrily on. After a time he thought he should
like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and
cried "Jip." Away went the horse full gallop, and
before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown
off, and lay in a ditch by the wayside, and his horse
would have run off if a shepherd, who was coming
by driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon
came to himself, and got upon his legs again. He
was sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd&mdash;</p>

<p>"This riding is no joke when a man gets on a
beast like this, that stumbles and flings him off as if
he would break his neck. However, I'm off now
once for all. I like your cow a great deal better;
one can walk along at one's leisure behind her, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
have milk, butter, and cheese every day into the
bargain. What would I give to have such a cow!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the shepherd, "if you are so fond of
her I will change my cow for your horse."</p>

<p>"Done!" said Hans merrily.</p>

<p>The shepherd jumped upon the horse and away
he rode. Hans drove off his cow quietly, and
thought his bargain a very lucky one.</p>

<p>"If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly
shall be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat
my butter and cheese with it, and when I am thirsty
I can milk my cow and drink the milk. What can I
wish for more?" said he.</p>

<p>When he came to an inn he halted, ate up all his
bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of
beer. Then he drove his cow towards his mother's
village. The heat grew greater as noon came on,
till at last he found himself on a wide heath that it
would take him more than an hour to cross, and he
began to be so hot and parched that his tongue
cleaved to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I can find a cure for this," thought he; "now
will I milk my cow and quench my thirst." So he
tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his
leathern cap to milk into, but not a drop was to
be had.</p>

<p>While he was trying his luck, and managing the
matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast gave him a
kick on the head that knocked him down, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher
came by driving a pig in a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" said the butcher,
as he helped him up.</p>

<p>Hans told him what had happened, and the
butcher gave him a flask, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, drink and refresh yourself. Your cow
will give you no milk; she is an old beast, good for
nothing but the slaughter-house."</p>

<p>"Alas, alas!" said Hans, "who would have
thought it? If I kill her, what will she be good
for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for
me. If it were a pig, now, one could do something
with it; it would at any rate make some sausages."</p>

<p>"Well," said the butcher, "to please you I'll
change and give you the pig for the cow."</p>

<p>"Heaven reward you for your kindness!" said
Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow and took the
pig off the wheelbarrow and drove it off, holding it
by a string tied to its leg.</p>

<p>So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right
with him. He had met with some misfortunes, to be
sure, but he was now well repaid for all. The next
person he met was a countryman carrying a fine
white goose under his arm. The countryman
stopped to ask what was the hour, and Hans told
him all his luck, and how he had made so many good
bargains. The countryman said he was going to
take the goose to a christening.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
"Feel," said he, "how heavy it is, and yet it is
only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it
may cut plenty of fat off, it has lived so well."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Hans, as he weighed it in
his hand; "but my pig is no trifle."</p>

<p>Meantime the countryman began to look grave,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Hark ye," said he, "my good friend. Your pig
may get you into a scrape. In the village I have
just come from the squire has had a pig stolen out
of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw
you that you had got the squire's pig. It will be
a bad job if they catch you, for the least they'll do
will be to throw you into the horse-pond."</p>

<p>Poor Hans was sadly frightened.</p>

<p>"Good man," cried he, "pray get me out of this
scrape. You know this country better than I; take
my pig and give me the goose."</p>

<p>"I ought to have something into the bargain,"
said the countryman; "however, I'll not bear hard
upon you, as you are in trouble."</p>

<p>Then he took the string in his hand and drove
off the pig by a side path, while Hans went on his
way homeward free from care.</p>

<p>"After all," thought he, "I have the best of the
bargain. First there will be a capital roast, then
the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months,
and then there are all the beautiful white feathers.
I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy
my mother will be!"</p>

<p>As he came to the last village he saw a scissors-grinder,
with his wheel, working away and singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O'er hill and o'er dale so happy I roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work light and live well, all the world is my home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who so blythe, so merry as I?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hans stood looking for a while, and at last said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must be well off, master grinder, you seem
so happy at your work."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade.
A good grinder never puts his hand in his pocket
without finding money in it&mdash;but where did you
get that beautiful goose?"</p>

<p>"I did not buy it, but changed a pig for it."</p>

<p>"And where did you get the pig?"</p>

<p>"I gave a cow for it."</p>

<p>"And the cow?"</p>

<p>"I gave a horse for it."</p>

<p>"And the horse?"</p>

<p>"I gave a piece of silver as big as my head for
that."</p>

<p>"And the silver?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years."</p>

<p>"You have thriven well in the world hitherto,"
said the grinder, "now if you could find money in
your pocket whenever you put your hand into it
your fortune would be made."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
"Very true, but how is that to be managed?"</p>

<p>"You must turn grinder like me," said the other.
"You only want a grindstone, the rest will come of
itself. Here is one that is only a little the worse
for wear. I would not ask more than the value of
your goose for it. Will you buy it?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask such a question?" said Hans.
"I should be the happiest man in the world if I
could have money whenever I put my hand in my
pocket. What could I want more? There's the
goose."</p>

<p>"Now," said the grinder, as he gave him a
common rough stone that lay by his side, "this is
a most capital stone. Do but manage it cleverly
and you can make an old nail cut with it."</p>

<p>Hans took the stone, and went off with a light
heart. His eyes sparkled with joy, and he said to
himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must have been born in a lucky hour. Everything
I want or wish comes to me of itself."</p>

<p>Meantime he began to be tired, for he had been
travelling ever since daybreak. He was hungry too,
for he had given away his last penny in his joy at
getting the cow. At last he could go no further,
and the stone tired him terribly, so he dragged himself
to the side of the pond that he might drink some
water and rest a while. He laid the stone carefully
by his side on the bank, but as he stooped down to
drink he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
went, plump into the pond. For a while he watched
it sinking in the deep, clear water, then, sprang up
for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked
Heaven with tears in his eyes for its kindness in
taking away his only plague, the ugly, heavy stone.</p>

<p>"How happy am I!" cried he; "no mortal was
ever so lucky as I am."</p>

<p>Then he got up with a light and merry heart, and
walked on, free from all his troubles, till he reached
his mother's house.</p>

<h2>THE GREY MARE IN THE GARRET.</h2>


<p>In the portal of the Church of the Apostles, near
the new market in Cologne, hung a picture, the
portraits of a certain Frau Richmodis von Aducht
and her two children, of whom the following singular
story is related. The picture was covered with
a curtain which she worked with her own hands.</p>

<p>Her husband, Richmuth von Aducht, was, in the
year of grace 1400, a rich burgomaster of Cologne,
and lived at the sign of the Parroquet in the New
Marckt. In that year a fearful plague desolated all
quarters of the city. She fell sick of the pest, and,
to all appearance, died. After the usual period had
elapsed she was buried in the vaults of the Apostles'
Church. She was buried, as the custom then was,
with her jewelled rings on her fingers, and most of
her rich ornaments on her person. These tempted
the cupidity of the sexton of the church. He
argued with himself that they were no use to the
corpse, and he determined to possess them. Accordingly
he proceeded in the dead of night to the vault
where she lay interred, and commenced the work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
of sacrilegious spoliation. He first unscrewed the
coffin lid. He then removed it altogether, and proceeded
to tear away the shroud which interposed
between him and his prey. But what was his
horror to perceive the corpse clasp her hands slowly
together, then rise, and finally sit erect in the coffin.
He was rooted to the earth. The corpse made as
though it would step from its narrow bed, and the
sexton fled, shrieking, through the vaults. The
corpse followed, its long white shroud floating like
a meteor in the dim light of the lamp, which, in his
haste, he had forgotten. It was not until he reached
his own door that he had sufficient courage to look
behind him, and then, when he perceived no trace of
his pursuer, the excitement which had sustained
him so far subsided, and he sank senseless to the
earth.</p>

<p>In the meantime Richmuth von Aducht, who had
slept scarcely a moment since the death of his dear
wife, was surprised by the voice of his old manservant,
who rapped loudly at his chamber door,
and told him to awake and come forth, for his
mistress had arisen from the dead, and was then at
the gate of the courtyard.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said he, rather pettishly, "go thy ways,
Hans; you dream, or are mad, or drunk. What you
see is quite impossible. I should as soon believe
my old grey mare had got into the garret as that
my wife was at the courtyard gate."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
Trot, trot, trot, trot, suddenly resounded high
over his head.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked he of his servant.</p>

<p>"I know not," replied the man, "an' it be not
your old grey mare in the garret."</p>

<p>They descended in haste to the courtyard, and
looked up to the window of the attic. Lo and behold!
there was indeed the grey mare with her head
poked out of the window, gazing down with her
great eyes on her master and his man, and seeming
to enjoy very much her exalted station, and their
surprise at it.</p>

<p>Knock, knock, knock went the rapper of the
street gate.</p>

<p>"It is my wife!" "It is my mistress!" exclaimed
master and man in the same breath.</p>

<p>The door was quickly unfastened, and there,
truly, stood the mistress of the mansion, enveloped
in her shroud.</p>

<p>"Are you alive or dead?" exclaimed the astonished
husband.</p>

<p>"Alive, my dear, but very cold," she murmured
faintly, her teeth chattering the while, as those of
one in a fever chill; "help me to my chamber."</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms and covered her with
kisses. Then he bore her to her chamber, and
called up the whole house to welcome and assist
her. She suffered a little from fatigue and fright,
but in a few days was very much recovered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
The thing became the talk of the town, and
hundreds flocked daily to see, not alone the lady
that was rescued from the grave in so remarkable a
manner, but also the grey mare which had so
strangely contrived to get into the garret.</p>

<p>The excellent lady lived long and happily with
her husband, and at her death was laid once more
in her old resting-place. The grey mare, after resting
in the garret three days, was got down by means
of scaffolding, safe and sound. She survived her
mistress for some time, and was a general favourite
in the city, and when she died her skin was stuffed,
and placed in the arsenal as a curiosity. The sexton
went mad with the fright he had sustained, and
in a short time entered that bourn whence he
had so unintentionally recovered the burgomaster's
wife.</p>

<p>Not only was this memorable circumstance commemorated
in the Church of the Apostles, but it
was also celebrated in <i>bassi relievi</i> figures on the
walls of the burgomaster's residence&mdash;the sign of
the Parroquet in the New Marckt. The searcher
after antiquities will, however, look in vain for
either. They are not now to be found. Modern
taste has defaced the porch where stood the one,
and erected a shapeless structure on the site of the
other.</p>

<h2>THE WATER SPIRIT.</h2>


<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century, when
Z&uuml;ndorf was no larger than it is at present, there
lived at the end of the village, hard by the church,
one of that useful class of women termed midwives.
She was an honest, industrious creature, and what
with ushering the new-born into life, and then
assisting in making garments for them, she contrived
to creep through the world in comfort, if not
in complete happiness.</p>

<p>The summer had been one of unusual drought,
and the winter, of a necessity, one of uncommon
scarcity, so that when the spring arrived the good
woman had less to do than at any period in the
preceding seven years. In fact she was totally
unemployed. As she mused one night, lying abed,
on the matter, she was startled by a sharp, quick
knock at the door of her cottage. She hesitated for
a moment to answer the call, but the knocking was
repeated with more violence than before. This
caused her to spring out of bed without more delay,
and hasten to ascertain the wish of her impatient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
visitor. She opened the door in the twinkling of
an eye, and a man, tall of stature, enveloped in a
large dark cloak, stood before her.</p>

<p>"My wife is in need of thee," he said to her
abruptly; "her time is come. Follow me."</p>

<p>"Nay, but the night is dark, sir," replied she.
"Whither do you desire me to follow?"</p>

<p>"Close at hand," he answered, as abruptly as
before. "Be ye quick and follow me."</p>

<p>"I will but light my lamp and place it in the
lantern," said the woman. "It will not cost me
more than a moment's delay."</p>

<p>"It needs not, it needs not," repeated the
stranger; "the spot is close by. I know every foot
of ground. Follow, follow!"</p>

<p>There was something so imperative, and at the
same time so irresistible, in the manner of the man
that she said not another word, but drawing her
warm cloak about her head followed him at once.
Ere she was aware of the course he had taken, so
dark was the night, and so wrapt up was she in the
cloak and in her meditations, she found herself
on the bank of the Rhine, just opposite to the low
fertile islet which bears the same name as the
village, and lies at a little distance from the shore.</p>

<p>"How is this, good sir?" she exclaimed, in a
tone of surprise and alarm. "You have missed the
way&mdash;you have left your road. Here is no further
path."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
"Silence, and follow," were the only words he
spoke in reply; but they were uttered in such a
manner as to show her at once that her best course
was obedience.</p>

<p>They were now at the edge of the mighty stream;
the rushing waters washed their feet. The poor
woman would fain have drawn back, but she could
not, such was the preternatural power exercised
over her by her companion.</p>

<p>"Fear not; follow!" he spoke again, in a kinder
tone, as the current kissed the hem of her garments.</p>

<p>He took the lead of her. The waters opened to
receive him. A wall of crystal seemed built up on
either side of the vista. He plunged into its
depths; she followed. The wild wave gurgled over
them, and they were walking over the shiny pebbles
and glittering sands which strewed the bed of the
river.</p>

<p>And now a change came over her indeed. She
had left all on earth in the thick darkness of a
starless spring night, yet all around her was lighted
up like a mellow harvest eve, when the sun shines
refulgent through masses of golden clouds on the
smiling pastures and emerald meadows of the west.
She looked up, but she could see no cause for this
illumination. She looked down, and her search
was equally unsuccessful. She seemed to herself to
traverse a great hall of surpassing transparency,
lighted up by a light resembling that given out by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
a huge globe of ground glass. Her conductor still
preceded her. They approached a little door.
The chamber within it contained the object of
their solicitude. On a couch of mother-of-pearl,
surrounded by sleeping fishes and drowsy syrens,
who could evidently afford her no assistance, lay
the sick lady.</p>

<p>"Here is my wife," spake the stranger, as they
entered this chamber. "Take her in hand at once,
and hark ye, mother, heed that she has no injury
through thee, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With these words he waved his hand, and, preceded
by the obedient inhabitants of the river, who
had until then occupied the chamber, left the
apartment.</p>

<p>The midwife approached her patient with fear
and trembling; she knew not what to anticipate.
What was her surprise to perceive that the stranger
was like any other lady. The business in hand
was soon finished, and midwife and patient began
to talk together, as women will when an opportunity
is afforded them.</p>

<p>"It surprises me much," quoth the former, "to
see such a handsome young lady as you are buried
down here in the bottom of the river. Do you
never visit the land? What a loss it is to you!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" interposed the Triton's lady,
placing her forefinger significantly on her lips;
"you peril your life by talking thus without guard.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
Go to the door; look out, that you may see if there
be any listeners, then I will tell something to surprise
you."</p>

<p>The midwife did as she was directed. There
was no living being within earshot.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," said the lady.</p>

<p>The midwife was all ear.</p>

<p>"I am a woman; a Christian woman like yourself,"
she continued, "though I am here now in the
home of my husband, who is the spirit of these
mighty waters."</p>

<p>"God be praised!" ejaculated her auditor.</p>

<p>"My father was the lord of the hamlet of Rheidt,
a little above L&uuml;lsdorf, and I lived there in peace
and happiness during my girlish days. I had nothing
to desire, as every wish was gratified by him
as soon as it was formed. However, as I grew to
womanhood I felt that my happiness had departed.
I knew not whither it had gone, or why, but gone
it was. I felt restless, melancholy, wretched. I
wanted, in short, something to love, but that I
found out since. Well, one day a merry-making
took place in the village, and every one was present
at it. We danced on the green sward which
stretches to the margin of the river; for that day I
forgot my secret grief, and was among the gayest of
the gay. They made me the queen of the feast, and
I had the homage of all. As the sun was going down
in glory in the far west, melting the masses of clouds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
into liquid gold, a stranger of a noble mien appeared
in the midst of our merry circle. He was garbed in
green from head to heel, and seemed to have crossed
the river, for the hem of his rich riding-cloak was
dripping with wet. No one knew him, no one
cared to inquire who he was, and his presence rather
awed than rejoiced us. He was, however, a stranger,
and he was welcome. When I tell you that
stranger is my husband, you may imagine the rest.
When the dance then on foot was ended, he asked
my hand. I could not refuse it if I would, but I
would not if I could. He was irresistible. We
danced and danced until the earth seemed to reel
around us. I could perceive, however, even in the
whirl of tumultuous delight which forced me onward,
that we neared the water's edge in every successive
figure. We stood at length on the verge of the
stream. The current caught my dress, the villagers
shrieked aloud, and rushed to rescue me from the
river.</p>

<p>"'Follow!' said my partner, plunging as he spoke
into the foaming flood.</p>

<p>"I followed. Since then I have lived with him
here. It is now a century since, but he has communicated
to me a portion of his own immortality,
and I know not age, neither do I dread death any
longer. He is good and kind to me, though
fearful to others. The only cause of complaint I
have is his invariable custom of destroying every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
babe to which I give birth on the third day
after my delivery. He says it is for my sake,
and for their sakes, that he does so, and he knows
best."</p>

<p>She sighed heavily as she said this.</p>

<p>"And now," resumed the lady, "I must give you
one piece of advice, which, if you would keep your
life, you must implicitly adopt. My husband will
return. Be on your guard, I bid you. He will
offer you gold, he will pour out the countless treasures
he possesses before you, he will proffer you diamonds
and pearls and priceless gems, but&mdash;heed well what
I say to you&mdash;take nothing more from him than
you would from any other person. Take the exact
sum you are wont to receive on earth, and take not
a kreutzer more, or your life is not worth a moment's
purchase. It is forfeit."</p>

<p>"He must be a cruel being, indeed," ejaculated
the midwife. "God deliver me from this dread
and great danger."</p>

<p>"See you yon sealed vessels?" spake the lady,
without seeming to heed her fright, or hear her
ejaculations.</p>

<p>The midwife looked, and saw ranged on an upper
shelf of the apartment about a dozen small pots,
like pipkins, all fast sealed, and labelled in unknown
characters.</p>

<p>"These pots," pursued she, "contain the souls of
those who have been, like you, my attendants in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
childbirth, but who, for slighting the advice I gave
them, as I now give you, and permitting a spirit of
unjust gain to take possession of their hearts, were
deprived of life by my husband. Heed well what I
say. He comes. Be silent and discreet."</p>

<p>As she spake the water spirit entered. He first
asked his wife how she did, and his tones were like
the rushing sound of a current heard far off. Learning
from her own lips that all was well with her,
he turned to the midwife and thanked her most
graciously.</p>

<p>"Now, come with me," he said, "I must pay thee
for thy services."</p>

<p>She followed him from the sick-chamber to the
treasury of the palace. It was a spacious crystal
vault, lighted up, like the rest of the palace, from
without, but within it was resplendent with treasures
of all kinds. He led her to a huge heap of
shining gold which ran the whole length of the
chamber.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "take what you will. I put no
stint upon you."</p>

<p>The trembling woman picked up a single piece of
the smallest coin she could find upon the heap.</p>

<p>"This is my fee," she spake. "I ask no more
than a fair remuneration for my labour."</p>

<p>The water spirit's brow blackened like a tempestuous
night, and he showed his green teeth for a
moment as if in great ire, but the feeling, whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
it was, appeared to pass away as quickly as it came,
and he led her to a huge heap of pearls.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "take what you will. Perhaps
you like these better? They are all pearls of great
price, or may be you would wish for some memento
of me. Take what you will."</p>

<p>But she still declined to take anything more,
although he tempted her with all his treasures.
She had not forgotten the advice of her
patient.</p>

<p>"I desire nothing more from you, great prince as
you are, than I receive from one of my own condition."
This was her uniform answer to his
entreaties&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank you, but I may not take aught beside
my due."</p>

<p>"If," said he, after a short pause, "you had
taken more than your due, you would have perished
at my hands. And now," proceeded the spirit,
"you shall home, but first take this. Fear
not."</p>

<p>As he spake he dipped his hand in the heap of
gold and poured forth a handful into her lap.</p>

<p>"Use that," he continued, "use it without fear.
It is my gift. No evil will come of it; I give you
my royal word."</p>

<p>He beckoned her onward without waiting for her
reply, and they were walking once again through
the corridors of the palace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
"Adieu!" he said, waving his hand to her,
"adieu!"</p>

<p>Darkness fell around her in a moment. In a
moment more she awoke, as from a dream, in her
warm bed.</p>

<h2>PETER KLAUS.</h2>


<p>Peter Klaus, a goatherd of Sittendorf, who tended
herds on the Kyffhauser mountain, used to let them
rest of an evening in a spot surrounded by an old
wall, where he always counted them to see if they
were all right. For some days he noticed that one
of his finest goats, as they came to this spot,
vanished, and never returned to the herd till late.
He watched him more closely, and at length saw
him slip through a rent in the wall. He followed
him, and caught him in a cave, feeding sumptuously
upon the grains of oats which fell one by one from
the roof. He looked up, shook his head at the
shower of oats, but, with all his care, could discover
nothing further. At length he heard overhead the
neighing and stamping of some mettlesome horses,
and concluded that the oats must have fallen from
their mangers.</p>

<p>While the goatherd stood there, wondering about
these horses in a totally uninhabited mountain, a
lad came and made signs to him to follow him
silently. Peter ascended some steps, and, crossing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
a walled court, came to a glade surrounded by rocky
cliffs, into which a sort of twilight made its way
through the thick-leaved branches. Here he found
twelve grave old knights playing at skittles, at a
well-levelled and fresh plot of grass. Peter was
silently appointed to set up the ninepins for them.</p>

<p>At first his knees knocked together as he did
this, while he marked, with half-stolen glances, the
long beards and goodly paunches of the noble
knights. By degrees, however, he grew more confident,
and looked at everything about him with a
steady gaze&mdash;nay, at last, he ventured so far as to
take a draught from a pitcher which stood near
him, the fragrance of which appeared to him delightful.
He felt quite revived by the draught, and
as often as he felt at all tired, received new strength
from application to the inexhaustible pitcher. But
at length sleep overcame him.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he found himself once more in
the enclosed green space, where he was accustomed
to leave his goats. He rubbed his eyes, but could
discover neither dog nor goats, and stared with surprise
at the height to which the grass had grown,
and at the bushes and trees, which he never remembered
to have noticed. Shaking his head, he proceeded
along the roads and paths which he was
accustomed to traverse daily with his herd, but
could nowhere see any traces of his goats. Below
him he saw Sittendorf; and at last he descended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
with quickened step, there to make inquiries after
his herd.</p>

<p>The people whom he met at his entrance to the
town were unknown to him, and dressed and
spoke differently from those whom he had known
there. Moreover, they all stared at him when he
inquired about his goats, and began stroking their
chins. At last, almost involuntarily, he did the
same, and found to his great astonishment that his
beard had grown to be a foot long. He began now
to think himself and the world altogether bewitched,
and yet he felt sure that the mountain from which
he had descended was the Kyffhauser; and the
houses here, with their fore-courts, were all familiar
to him. Moreover, several lads whom he heard
telling the name of the place to a traveller called it
Sittendorf.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he proceeded into the town
straight to his own house. He found it sadly fallen
to decay. Before it lay a strange herd-boy in
tattered garments, and near him an old worn-out
dog, which growled and showed his teeth at Peter
when he called him. He entered by the opening,
which had formerly been closed by a door, but
found all within so desolate and empty that he
staggered out again like a drunkard, and called his
wife and children. No one heard; no voice answered
him.</p>

<p>Women and children now began to surround the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
strange old man, with the long hoary beard, and to
contend with one another in inquiring of him what
he wanted. He thought it so ridiculous to make
inquiries of strangers, before his own house, after
his wife and children, and still more so, after himself,
that he mentioned the first neighbour whose
name occurred to him, Kirt Stiffen. All were silent,
and looked at one another, till an old woman said&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has left here these twelve years. He lives
at Sachsenberg; you'll hardly get there to-day."</p>

<p>"Velten Maier?"</p>

<p>"God help him!" said an old crone leaning on a
crutch. "He has been confined these fifteen years
in the house, which he'll never leave again."</p>

<p>He recognised, as he thought, his suddenly aged
neighbour; but he had lost all desire of asking any
more questions. At last a brisk young woman, with
a boy of a twelvemonth old in her arms, and with a
little girl holding her hand, made her way through
the gaping crowd, and they looked for all the
world like his wife and children.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said Peter, astonished.</p>

<p>"Maria."</p>

<p>"And your father?"</p>

<p>"God have mercy on him, Peter Klaus. It is
twenty years since we sought him day and night on
the Kyffhauser, when his goats came home without
him. I was only seven years old when it happened."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
The goatherd could no longer contain himself.</p>

<p>"I am Peter Klaus," he cried, "and no other,"
and he took the babe from his daughter's arms.</p>

<p>All stood like statues for a minute, till one and
then another began to cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's Peter Klaus come back again! Welcome,
neighbour, welcome, after twenty years; welcome,
Peter Klaus!"</p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF RHEINECK.</h2>


<p>Graf Ulric Von Rheineck was a very wild youth.
Recklessly and without consideration did he plunge
into every excess. Dissipation grew to be the habit
of his life, and no sensual indulgence did he deny
himself which could be procured by any means
whatever. Amply provided for as he was, the
revenues of his wide possessions, which comprehended
Thal Rheineck, and the adjacent country, to
the shore of the Rhine, and as far as the mouth of
the Aar, were soon discovered to be insufficient for
all his absorbing necessities. One by one his broad
lands were alienated from him, piece after piece of
that noble possession fell from his house, until
finally he found himself without a single inch of
ground which he could call his own, save the small
and unproductive spot on which Rheineck stood.
This he had no power to transfer, or perhaps it
would have gone with the remainder. The castle
had fallen sadly into disrepair, through his protracted
absence from home, and his continual
neglect of it,&mdash;indeed there was scarcely a habitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
room within its precincts, and he now had no means
to make it the fitting abode of any one, still less
of a nobleman of his rank and consequence. All
without, as well as all within it, was desolate and
dreary to the last degree. The splendid garden,
previously the pride of his ancestors, was overrun
with weeds, and tangled with parasites and creepers.
The stately trees, which once afforded shelter and
shade, as well as fruits of the finest quality and
rarest kinds, were all dying or withered, or had
their growth obstructed by destroying plants. The
outer walls were in a ruinous condition, the fortifications
were everywhere fallen into decay, and the
alcoves and summer-houses had dropped down, or
were roofless, and exposed to the weather. It was
a cheerless prospect to contemplate, but he could
not now help himself, even if he had the will to do
so. Day after day the same scene of desolation
presented itself to his eyes, night after night did
the same cheerless chamber present itself to his
view. It was his own doing. That he could not
deny, and bitterly he rued it. To crown his helplessness
and misery, his vassals and domestic servants
abandoned him by degrees, one after another,
and at last he was left entirely alone in the house
of his fathers&mdash;a hermit in that most dismal of all
solitudes, the desolate scene of one's childish, one's
happiest recollections.</p>

<p>One evening about twilight, as he sat at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
outer gate, looking sadly on the broad, bright river
which flowed calmly beneath, he became aware of
the presence of a stranger, who seemed to toil
wearily up the steep acclivity on the summit of
which the castle is situated. The stranger&mdash;an
unusual sight within those walls then&mdash;soon reached
the spot where Ulric sat, and, greeting the youth in
the fashion of the times, prayed him for shelter
during the night, and refreshment after his most
painful journey.</p>

<p>"I am," quoth the stranger, "a poor pilgrim on
my way to Cologne, where, by the merits of the
three wise kings&mdash;to whose shrine I am bound&mdash;I
hope to succeed in the object of my journey."</p>

<p>Graf Ulric von Rheineck at once accorded him
the hospitality he required, for though he had but
scant cheer for himself, and nought of comfort to
bestow, he had still some of the feeling of a gentleman
left in him.</p>

<p>"I am alone here now," said he to the pilgrim,
with a deep sigh. "I am myself as poor as Job.
Would it were not so! My menials have left me
to provide for themselves, as I can no longer provide
for them. 'Twas ever the way of the world,
and I blame them not for it. The last departed
yesterday. He was an old favourite of my father's,
and he once thought that he would not leave my
service but with his life. We must now look to
ourselves, however,&mdash;at least so he said. But that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
has nothing to do with the matter, so enter, my
friend."</p>

<p>They entered. By their joint exertions a simple
evening meal was soon made ready, and speedily
spread forth on a half-rotten plank, their only table.</p>

<p>"I have no better to offer you," observed the
young Count, "but I offer you what I have with
right goodwill. Eat, if you can, and be merry."</p>

<p>They ate in silence, neither speaking during the
meal.</p>

<p>"Surely," said the pilgrim, when it was over,&mdash;"surely
it may not be that the extensive cellars of
this great castle contain not a single cup of wine
for the weary wayfarer."</p>

<p>The Count was at once struck by the idea. It
seemed to him as if he had never thought of it
before, though in reality he had ransacked every
corner of the cellars more than once.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go together and try," continued
the pilgrim; "it will go hard with us if we find
nought to wash down our homely fare."</p>

<p>Accompanied by his persuasive guest, the Count
descended to the vaults, where the wines of Rheineck
had been stored for ages. Dark and dreary did they
seem to him. A chill fell on his soul as he strode
over the mouldy floor.</p>

<p>"Here," said the pilgrim, with great glee,&mdash;"here,
here! Look ye, my master, look ye! See! I have
found a cup of the best."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
The Count passed into a narrow cellar whither
the pilgrim had preceded him. There stood his
companion beside a full butt of burgundy, holding
in his hand a massive silver cup, foaming over with
the generous beverage, and with the other he
pointed exultingly to his prize. The scene seemed
like a dream to Ulric. The place was wholly unknown
to him. The circumstances were most
extraordinary. He mused a moment, but he knew
not what to do in the emergency.</p>

<p>"We will enjoy ourselves here," said the pilgrim.
"Here, on this very spot, shall we make us merry!
Ay, here, beside this noble butt of burgundy. See,
'tis the best vintage! Let us be of good cheer!"</p>

<p>The Count and his boon companion sat down on
two empty casks, and a third served them for a table.
They plied the brimming beakers with right goodwill;
they drank with all their might and main.
The Count became communicative, and talked about
his private affairs, as men in liquor will. The
pilgrim, however, preserved a very discreet silence,
only interrupting by an occasional interjection of
delight, or an opportune word of encouragement to
his garrulous friend.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," began the pilgrim, when
the Count had concluded his tale,&mdash;"I'll tell you
what. Listen: I know a way to get you out of
your difficulties, to rid you of all your embarrassments."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
The Count looked at him incredulously for a
moment; his eye could not keep itself steady for a
longer space of time. There was something in the
pilgrim's glance as it met his that greatly dissipated
his unbelief, and he inquired of him how these
things could be brought about.</p>

<p>"But, mayhap," continued the pilgrim, apparently
disregarding the manifest change in his companion's
impressions regarding him,&mdash;"mayhap you would be
too faint-hearted to follow my advice if I gave it
you."</p>

<p>The Count sprang on his feet in a trice, and half-unsheathed
his sword to avenge this taunt on his
manhood, but the pilgrim looked so unconcerned,
and evinced so little emotion at this burst of anger,
that the action and its result were merely momentary.
Ulric resumed his seat, and the pilgrim proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"You tell me that you once heard from your
father, who had it from his father, that your great-grandfather,
in the time when this castle was
beleaguered by the Emperor Conrad, buried a vast
treasure in some part of it, but which part his
sudden death prevented him from communicating to
his successor?"</p>

<p>The Count nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>"It is even so," he said.</p>

<p>"In Eastern lands have I learned to discover
where concealed treasures are hidden," pursued the
pilgrim; "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
The Count grasped him by the hand.</p>

<p>"Find them," he cried,&mdash;"find them for me, and
a full half is thine! Oh, there is gold, and there
are diamonds and precious stones of all kinds.
They are there in abundance. My father said so!
'Tis true, 'tis true! Find them, find them, and then
shall this old hall ring once more with the voice of
merriment. Then shall we live! ay, we shall live!
that we shall."</p>

<p>The pilgrim did not attempt to interrupt his
ecstasies, or to interpose between him and the excess
of his glee, but let him excite himself to the highest
pitch with pictures of the pleasing future, until they
had acquired almost the complexion of fact and the
truth of reality for his distracted imagination.
When he had exhausted himself, the wily tempter
resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I know it all. I know where the
treasure is. I can put your finger on it if I like.
I was present when the old man buried it in
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You present!" exclaimed Ulric, his hair standing
on end with horror, for he had no doubts of the
truth of the mysterious stranger's statements,&mdash;"you
present!"</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed the pilgrim; "I was present."</p>

<p>"But he is full a hundred years dead and buried,"
continued the Count.</p>

<p>"No matter for that, no matter for that," replied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
the guest abruptly; "many and many a time have
we drunk and feasted and revelled together in this
vault&mdash;ay, in this very vault."</p>

<p>The Count knew not what to think, still less what
to reply to this information. He could not fail to
perceive its improbability, drunk as he was, but still
he could not, for the life of him, discredit it.</p>

<p>"But," added the pilgrim, "trouble not yourself
with that at present which you have not the power
to comprehend, and speculate not on my proceedings,
but listen to my words, and follow my advice, if you
will that I should serve you in the matter."</p>

<p>The Count was silent when the stranger proceeded.</p>

<p>"This is Walpurgis night," he said. "All the
spirits of earth and sea and sky are now abroad
on their way to the Brocken. Hell is broke loose,
you know, for its annual orgies on that mountain.
When the castle clock tolls twelve go you into the
chapel, and proceed to the graves of your grandfather,
your great-grandfather, and your great-great-grandfather;
take from their coffins the bones of
their skeletons&mdash;take them all, mind ye. One by
one you must then remove them into the moonlight,
outside the walls of the building, and there lay them
softly on the bit of green sward which faces to the
south. This done, you must next place them in the
order in which they lay in their last resting-place.
When you have completed that task, you must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
return to the chapel, and in their coffins you will
find the treasures of your forefathers. No one has
power over an atom of them, until the bones of
those who in spirit keep watch and ward over them
shall have been removed from their guardianship.
So long as they rest on them, or oversee them, to
the dead they belong. It is a glorious prize. 'Twill
be the making of you, man, for ever!"</p>

<p>Ulric was shocked at the proposal. To desecrate
the graves of his fathers was a deed which made
him shudder, and, bad as he was, the thought filled
him with the greatest horror, but the temptation
was irresistible.</p>

<p>At the solemn hour of midnight he proceeded to
the chapel, accompanied by the pilgrim. He entered
the holy place with trembling, for his heart misgave
him. The pilgrim stayed without, apparently
anxious and uneasy as to the result of the experiment
about to be made. To all the solicitations of
the Count for assistance in his task he turned a deaf
ear; nothing that he could say could induce him to
set foot within the chapel walls.</p>

<p>Ulric opened the graves in the order in which
they were situated, beginning with the one first
from the door of the chapel. He proceeded to
remove the rotting remains from their mouldering
coffins. One by one did he bear their bleached
bones into the open air, as he had been instructed,
and placed them as they had lain in their narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
beds, under the pale moonbeams, on the plot of
green sward facing the south, outside the chapel
walls. The coffins were all cleared of their tenants,
except one which stood next to the altar, at the
upper end of the aisle. Ulric approached this also
to perform the wretched task he had set himself, the
thoughts of the treasure he should become possessed
of but faintly sustaining his sinking soul in the fearful
operation. Removing the lid of this last resting-place
of mortality, his heart failed him at the sight
he beheld. There lay extended, as if in deep sleep,
the corpse of a fair child, fresh and comely, as if it
still felt and breathed and had lusty being. The
weakness Ulric felt was but momentary. His companion
called aloud to him to finish his task quickly,
or the hour would have passed when his labour
would avail him. As he touched the corpse of the
infant the body stirred as if it had sensation. He
shrank back in horror as the fair boy rose gently in
his coffin, and at length stood upright within it.</p>

<p>"Bring back yon bones," said the phantom babe,&mdash;"bring
back yon bones; let them rest in peace in
the last home of their fathers. The curse of the
dead will be on you otherwise. Back! back! bring
them back ere it be too late."</p>

<p>The corpse sank down in the coffin again as it
uttered these words, and Ulric saw a skeleton lying
in its place. Shuddering, he averted his gaze, and
turned it towards the chapel door, where he had left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
his companion. But, horror upon horror! as he
looked he saw the long, loose, dark outer garment
fall from the limbs of the pilgrim. He saw his form
dilate and expand in height and in breadth, until
his head seemed to touch the pale crescent moon,
and his bulk shut out from view all beyond itself.
He saw his eyes firing and flaming like globes of
lurid light, and he saw his hair and beard converted
into one mass of living flame. The fiend stood
revealed in all his hideous deformity.</p>

<p>His hands were stretched forth to fasten on the
hapless Count, who, with vacillating step, like the
bird under the eye of the basilisk, involuntarily,
though with a perfect consciousness of his awful
situation, and the fearful fate which awaited him,
every moment drew nearer and nearer to him. The
victim reached the chapel door&mdash;he felt all the
power of that diabolical fascination&mdash;another step
and he would be in the grasp of the fiend who
grinned to clutch him. But the fair boy who spoke
from the grave suddenly appeared once more, and,
flinging himself between the wretched Count and the
door, obstructed his further progress.</p>

<p>"Avaunt, foul fiend!" spake the child, and his
voice was like a trumpet-note; "avaunt to hell! He
is no longer thine. Thou hast no power over him.
Your hellish plot has failed. He is free, and shall
live and repent."</p>

<p>As he said this he threw his arms around Ulric,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
and the Count became, as it were, at once surrounded
by a beatific halo, which lighted up the chapel like
day. The fiend fled howling like a wild beast disappointed
of its prey.</p>

<p>The remains of his ancestors were again replaced
in their coffins by the Count, long ere the morning
broke, and on their desecrated graves he poured
forth a flood of repentant tears. With the dawn of
day he quitted the castle of Rheineck. It is said that
he traversed the land in the garb of a lowly mendicant,
subsisting on the alms of the charitable, and it
is likewise told that he did penance at every holy
shrine from Cologne to Rome, whither he was bound
to obtain absolution for his sins. Years afterwards
he was found dead at the foot of the ancient altar
in the ruined chapel. The castle went to ruin, and
for centuries nought ever dwelt within its walls save
the night-birds and the beasts of prey.</p>

<p>Of the original structure the ruins of one old tower
are all that now remain. It is still firmly believed
by the peasants of the neighbourhood, that in the
first and the last quarter of the moon the spirit of
Ulric, the last of the old lords of Rheineck, still
sweeps around the ruin at the hour of midnight, and
is occasionally visible to belated wanderers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CELLAR OF THE OLD KNIGHTS
IN THE KYFFHAUSER.</h2>


<p>There was a poor, but worthy, and withal very
merry, fellow at Tilleda, who was once put to the
expense of a christening, and, as luck would have
it, it was the eighth. According to the custom of
the time, he was obliged to give a plain feast to the
child's sponsors. The wine of the country which
he put before his guests was soon exhausted, and
they began to call for more.</p>

<p>"Go," said the merry father of the newly baptized
child to his eldest daughter, a handsome girl
of sixteen,&mdash;"go, and get us better wine than this
out of the cellar."</p>

<p>"Out of what cellar?"</p>

<p>"Why, out of the great wine-cellar of the old
Knights in the Kyffhauser, to be sure," said her
father jokingly.</p>

<p>The simple-minded girl did as he told her, and
taking a small pitcher in her hand went to the
mountain. In the middle of the mountain she
found an aged housekeeper, dressed in a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
old-fashioned style, with a large bundle of keys at her
girdle, sitting at the ruined entrance of an immense
cellar. The girl was struck dumb with amazement,
but the old woman said very kindly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of a surety you want to draw wine out of the
Knights' cellar?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl timidly, "but I have no
money."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said the old woman; "come
with me, and you shall have wine for nothing, and
better wine too than your father ever tasted."</p>

<p>So the two went together through the half-blocked-up
entrance, and as they went along the
old woman made the girl tell her how affairs were
going on at that time in Tilleda.</p>

<p>"For once," said she, "when I was young, and
good-looking as you are, the Knights stole me away
in the night-time, and brought me through a hole
in the ground from the very house in Tilleda which
now belongs to your father. Shortly before that
they had carried away by force from Kelbra, in
broad daylight, the four beautiful damsels who
occasionally still ride about here on horses richly
caparisoned, and then disappear again. As for me,
as soon as I grew old, they made me their butler,
and I have been so ever since."</p>

<p>They had now reached the cellar door, which the
old woman opened. It was a very large roomy
cellar, with barrels ranged along both sides. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
old woman rapped against the barrels&mdash;some were
quite full, some were only half full. She took the
little pitcher, drew it full of wine, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, take that to your father, and as often as
you have a feast in your house you may come here
again; but, mind, tell nobody but your father
where you get the wine from. Mind, too, you must
never sell any of it&mdash;it costs nothing, and for
nothing you must give it away. Let any one but
come here for wine to make a profit off it and his
last bread is baked."</p>

<p>The girl took the wine to her father, whose
guests were highly delighted with it, and sadly
puzzled to think where it came from, and ever
afterwards, when there was a little merry-making
in the house, would the girl fetch wine from the
Kyffhauser in her little pitcher. But this state of
things did not continue long. The neighbours
wondered where so poor a man contrived to get
such delicious wine that there was none like it in
the whole country round. The father said not a
word to any one, and neither did his daughter.</p>

<p>Opposite to them, however, lived the publican
who sold adulterated wine. He had once tasted the
Old Knights' wine, and thought to himself that one
might mix it with ten times the quantity of water
and sell it for a good price after all. Accordingly,
when the girl went for the fourth time with her
little pitcher to the Kyffhauser, he crept after her,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
and concealed himself among the bushes, where he
watched until he saw her come out of the entrance
which led to the cellar, with her pitcher filled with
wine.</p>

<p>On the following evening he himself went to the
mountain, pushing before him in a wheelbarrow the
largest empty barrel he could procure. This he
thought of filling with the choicest wine in the
cellar, and in the night rolling it down the mountain,
and in this way he intended to come every
day, as long as there was any wine left in the
cellar.</p>

<p>When, however, he came to the place where he
had the day before seen the entrance to the cellar,
it grew all of a sudden totally dark. The wind
began to howl fearfully, and a monster threw him,
his barrow, and empty butt, from one ridge of rocks
to another, and he kept falling lower and lower,
until at last he fell into a cemetery.</p>

<p>There he saw before him a coffin covered with
black, and his wife and four of her gossips, whom
he knew well by their dress and figures, were
following a bier. His fright was so great that he
swooned away.</p>

<p>After some hours he came to himself again, and
saw, to his horror, that he was still in the dimly
lighted vaults, and heard just above his head the
well-known town clock of Tilleda strike twelve, and
thereby he knew that it was midnight, and that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
was then under the church, in the burying-place of
the town. He was more dead than alive, and
scarcely dared to breathe.</p>

<p>Presently there came a monk, who led him up a
long, long flight of steps, opened a door, placed,
without speaking, a piece of gold in his hand, and
deposited him at the foot of the mountain. It was
a cold frosty night. By degrees the publican
recovered himself, and crept, without barrel or
wine, back to his own home. The clock struck
one as he reached the door. He immediately took
to his bed, and in three days was a dead man, and
the piece of gold which the wizard monk had given
him was expended on his funeral.</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE.</h2>


<p>There was once a fisherman who lived with his
wife in a ditch close by the seaside. The fisherman
used to go out all day long a-fishing, and one day
as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the
shining water and watching his line, all of sudden
his float was dragged away deep under the sea. In
drawing it up he pulled a great fish out of the water.
The fish said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray let me live. I am not a real fish. I am
an enchanted prince. Put me in the water again
and let me go."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the man, "you need not make so
many words about the matter. I wish to have
nothing to do with a fish that can talk, so swim
away as soon as you please."</p>

<p>Then he put him back into the water, and the
fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a
long streak of blood behind him.</p>

<p>When the fisherman went home to his wife in
the ditch, he told her how he had caught a great
fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
prince, and that on hearing it speak he had let it
go again.</p>

<p>"Did you not ask it for anything?" said the wife.</p>

<p>"No," said the man; "what should I ask it for?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the wife, "we live very wretchedly
here in this nasty miserable ditch, do go back and
tell the fish we want a little cottage."</p>

<p>The fisherman did not much like the business;
however, he went to the sea, and when he came
there the water looked all yellow and green. He
sat at the water's edge and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O man of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come listen to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Alice my wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The plague of my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the fish came swimming to him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what does she want?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" answered the fisherman, "my wife says
that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked
you for something before I let you go again. She
does not like living any longer in the ditch, and
wants a little cottage."</p>

<p>"Go home, then," said the fish; "she is in the
cottage already."</p>

<p>So the man went home, and saw his wife standing
at the door of a cottage.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in," said she. "Is not this much
better than the ditch?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
There was a parlour, a bedchamber, and a kitchen;
and behind the cottage there was a little
garden with all sorts of flowers and fruits, and a
courtyard full of ducks and chickens.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the fisherman, "how happily we shall
live!"</p>

<p>"We will try to do so, at least," said his wife.</p>

<p>Everything went right for a week or two, and
then Dame Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Husband, there is not room enough in this
cottage, the courtyard and garden are a great deal
too small. I should like to have a large stone castle
to live in, so go to the fish again and tell him to
give us a castle."</p>

<p>"Wife," said the fisherman, "I don't like to go
to him again, for perhaps he will be angry. We
ought to be content with the cottage."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the wife, "he will do it very
willingly. Go along and try."</p>

<p>The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy,
and when he came to the sea it looked blue and
gloomy, though it was quite calm. He went close
to it, and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O man of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come listen to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Alice my wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The plague of my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Well, what does she want now?" said the fish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
"Ah!" said the man very sorrowfully, "my wife
wants to live in a stone castle."</p>

<p>"Go home, then," said the fish; "she is standing
at the door of it already."</p>

<p>Away went the fisherman, and found his wife
standing before a great castle.</p>

<p>"See," said she, "is not this grand?"</p>

<p>With that they went into the house together, and
found a great many servants there, the rooms all
richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and
tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and a
wood half a mile long, full of sheep, goats, hares,
and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and
cow-houses.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "now will we live contented
and happy for the rest of our lives."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may," said the wife, "but let us
consider and sleep upon it before we make up our
minds;" so they went to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning when Dame Alice awoke it
was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman
with her elbow, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we
must be king of all the land."</p>

<p>"Wife, wife," said the man, "why should we
wish to be king? I will not be king."</p>

<p>"Then I will," said Alice.</p>

<p>"But, wife," answered the fisherman, "how can
you be king? The fish cannot make you king."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
"Husband," said she, "say no more about it, but
go and try. I will be king."</p>

<p>So the man went away quite sorrowful, to think
that his wife should want to be king. The sea
looked a dark grey colour, and was covered with
foam, as he called the fish to come and help him.</p>

<p>"Well, what would she have now?" asked the
fish.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the man, "my wife wants to be
king."</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish, "she is king already."</p>

<p>Then the fisherman went home, and as he came
close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and
heard the sound of drums and trumpets; and when
he entered, he saw his wife sitting on a high throne
of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon
her head, and on each side of her stood six beautiful
maidens.</p>

<p>"Well, wife," said the fisherman, "are you king?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I am king."</p>

<p>When he had looked at her for a long time, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! wife, what a fine thing it is to be king!
now we shall never have anything more to wish
for."</p>

<p>"I don't know how that may be," said she.
"Never is a long time. I am king, 'tis true; but I
begin to be tired of it, and I think I should like to
be emperor."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
"Alas! wife, why should you wish to be emperor?"
said the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "go to the fish. I say I
will be emperor."</p>

<p>"Ah! wife," replied the fisherman, "the fish
cannot make an emperor; and I should not like to
ask for such a thing."</p>

<p>"I am king," said Alice; "and you are my slave,
so go directly."</p>

<p>So the fisherman was obliged to go, and he muttered
as he went along&mdash;</p>

<p>"This will come to no good. It is too much to
ask. The fish will be tired at last, and then we
shall repent of what we have done."</p>

<p>He soon arrived at the sea, and the water was
quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind
blew over it; but he went to the shore, and repeated
the words he had used before.</p>

<p>"What would she have now?" inquired the fish.</p>

<p>"She wants to be emperor," replied the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish, "she is emperor already."</p>

<p>So he went home again, and as he came near, he
saw his wife sitting on a very lofty throne made of
solid gold, with a crown on her head, full two yards
high; and on each side of her stood her guards and
attendants in a row, ranged according to height,
from the tallest giant to a little dwarf, no bigger
than one's finger. And before her stood princes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
and dukes, and earls; and the fisherman went up
to her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wife, are you emperor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I am emperor."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man, as he gazed on her, "what
a fine thing it is to be emperor!"</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "why should we stay at
being emperor? We will be pope next."</p>

<p>"O wife, wife!" said he. "How can you be
pope? There is but one pope at a time in Christendom."</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "I will be pope this very
day."</p>

<p>"But," replied the husband, "the fish cannot make
you pope."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said she. "If he can make an
emperor, he can make a pope; go and try him."</p>

<p>So the fisherman went; but when he came to the
shore the wind was raging, the sea was tossed up
and down like boiling water, and the ships were in
the greatest distress and danced upon the waves
most fearfully. In the middle of the sky there was
a little blue; but towards the south it was all red,
as if a dreadful storm was rising. The fisherman
repeated the words, and the fish appeared before
him.</p>

<p>"What does she want now?" asked the fish.</p>

<p>"My wife wants to be pope," said the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish; "she is pope already."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
Then the fisherman went home, and found his
wife sitting on a throne, with three crowns on her
head, while around stood all the pomp and power
of the Church. On each side were two rows of
burning lights of all sizes; the greatest as large as
a tower, and the smallest no larger than a rushlight.</p>

<p>"Well, wife," said the fisherman, as he looked at
all this grandeur, "are you pope?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she; "I am pope."</p>

<p>"Well," replied he, "it is a grand thing to be
pope; and now you must be content, for you can be
nothing greater."</p>

<p>"I will consider about that," replied the wife.</p>

<p>Then they went to bed; but Dame Alice could
not sleep all night for thinking what she should be
next. At last morning came, and the sun rose.</p>

<p>"Ha!" thought she, as she looked at it through
the window, "cannot I prevent the sun rising?"</p>

<p>At this she was very angry, and wakened her
husband, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Husband, go to the fish, and tell him I want to
be lord of the sun and moon."</p>

<p>The fisherman was half asleep; but the thought
frightened him so much that he started and fell out
of bed.</p>

<p>"Alas! wife," said he, "cannot you be content
to be pope?"</p>

<p>"No," said she, "I am very uneasy, and cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
bear to see the sun and moon rise without my
leave. Go to the fish directly."</p>

<p>Then the man went trembling for fear. As he
was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose,
so that the trees and the rocks shook, the heavens
became black, the lightning played, the thunder
rolled, and the sea was covered with black waves
like mountains, with a white crown of foam upon
them. The fisherman came to the shore, and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O man of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come listen to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Alice, my wife,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What does she want now?" asked the fish.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, "she wants to be lord of the sun
and moon."</p>

<p>"Go home," replied the fish, "to your ditch
again."</p>

<p>And there they live to this very day.</p>

<h2>THE MOUSE TOWER.</h2>


<p>To the traveller who has traversed the delightful
environs of the Rhine, from the city of Mentz as far
as Coblentz, or from the clear waves of this old
Germanic stream gazed upon the grand creations of
Nature, all upon so magnificent a scale, the appearance
of the old decayed tower which forms the
subject of the ensuing tradition forms no uninteresting
object. It rises before him as he mounts the
Rhine from the little island below Bingen, toward
the left shore. He listens to the old shipmaster as
he relates with earnest tone the wonderful story of
the tower, and, shuddering at the description of the
frightful punishment of priestly pride and cruelty,
exclaims in strong emotion&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lord be with us!"</p>

<p>For, as the saying runs, it was about the year of
Our Lord 968, when Hatto <small>II.</small>, Duke of the Ostro-franks,
surnamed Bonosus, Abbot of Fulda, a man
of singular skill and great spiritual endowments,
was elected Archbishop of Mentz. He was also a
harsh man, and being extremely avaricious, heaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
up treasure which he guarded with the utmost
care.</p>

<p>It so happened, under his spiritual sway, that a
cruel famine began to prevail in the city of Mentz
and its adjacent parts, insomuch that in a short
time numbers of the poorer people fell victims to
utter want. Crowds of wretches were to be seen
assembled before the Archbishop's palace in the act
of beseeching with cries and prayers for some mitigation
of their heavy lot.</p>

<p>But their harsh lord refused to afford relief out
of his own substance, reproaching them at the same
time as the authors of their own calamity by their
indolence and want of economy. But the poor
souls were mad for food, and in frightful and
threatening accents cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bread, bread!"</p>

<p>Fearing the result, Bishop Hatto ordered a vast
number of hungry souls to range themselves in order
in one of his empty barns under the pretence of
supplying them with provisions. Then, having
closed the doors, he commanded his minions to fire
the place, in which all fell victims to the flames.
When he heard the death shouts and shrieks of the
unhappy poor, turning towards the menial parasites
who abetted his crime he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hark you! how the mice squeak!"</p>

<p>But Heaven that witnessed the deed did not
permit its vengeance to sleep. A strange and unheard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
of death was preparing to loose its terrors upon
the sacrilegious prelate. For behold, there arose out
of the yet warm ashes of the dead an innumerable
throng of mice which were seen to approach the
Bishop, and to follow him whithersoever he went.
At length he flew into one of his steepest and
highest towers, but the mice climbed over the walls.
He closed every door and window, yet after him
they came, piercing their way through the smallest
nooks and crannies of the building. They poured
in upon him, and covered him from head to foot, in
numberless heaps. They bit, they scratched, they
tortured his flesh, till they nearly devoured him.
So great was the throng that the more his domestics
sought to beat them off, the more keen and savagely,
with increased numbers, did they return to the
charge. Even where his name was found placed
upon the walls and tapestries they gnawed it in
their rage away.</p>

<p>In this frightful predicament the Bishop, finding
that he could obtain no help on land, bethought of
taking himself to the water. A tower was hastily
erected upon the Rhine. He took ship and shut
himself up there. Enclosed within double walls,
and surrounded by water, he flattered himself that
the rushing stream would effectually check the rage
of his enemies. Here too, however, the vengeance
of offended Heaven gave them entrance. Myriads
of mice took to the stream, and swam and swam,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
and though myriads of them were swept away, an
innumerable throng still reached the spot. Again
they climbed and clattered up the walls. The
Bishop heard their approach. It was his last retreat.
They rushed in upon him with more irresistible
fury than before, and, amidst stifled cries of protracted
suffering, Bishop Hatto at length rendered
up his cruel and avaricious soul.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE DANCERS.</h2>


<p>The Sabbath-day drew to a close in the summer-tide
of the year of grace one thousand and one, and
the rustics of Ramersdorf amused themselves with a
dance, as was their wont to do, in the courtyard of
the monastery. It was a privilege that they had
enjoyed time immemorial, and it had never been
gainsaid by the abbots who were dead and gone,
but Anselm von Lowenberg, the then superior of the
convent, an austere, ascetic man, who looked with
disdain and dislike on all popular recreations, had
long set his face against it, and had, moreover, tried
every means short of actual prohibition to put an
end to the profane amusement. The rustics, however,
were not to be debarred by his displeasure
from pursuing, perhaps, their only pleasure; and
though the pious abbot discountenanced their proceedings,
they acquiesced not in his views, and their
enjoyment was not one atom the less.</p>

<p>The day had been very beautiful, and the evening
was, if possible, more so. Gaily garbed maidens of
the village and stalwart rustics filled the courtyard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
of the convent. A blind fiddler, who had fiddled
three generations off the stage, sat in front of a
group of elders of either sex, who, though too old
and too stiff to partake in the active and exciting
amusement, were still young enough to enjoy looking
on. A few shaven crowns peered from the latticed
casements which looked out on to the merry scene.
The music struck up, the dance began. Who
approaches? Why are so many anxious glances
cast in yonder direction? It is the Abbot.</p>

<p>"Cease your fooling," he spake to them, in a
solemn tone; "profane not the place nor the day
with your idle mirth. Go home, and pray in your
own homes for the grace of the Lord to govern ye,
for ye are wicked and wilful and hard of heart as
the stones!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand as if to disperse them, but
his words and his action were equally unheeded by
the dancers and the spectators.</p>

<p>"Forth, vile sinners!" he pursued. "Forth
from these walls, or I will curse ye with the curse."</p>

<p>Still they regarded him not to obey his behest,
although they so far noticed his words as to return
menacing look for look, and muttered threats for
threat with him. The music played on with the
same liveliness, the dancers danced as merrily as
ever, and the spectators applauded each display of
agility.</p>

<p>"Well, then," spake the Abbot, bursting with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
rage, "an ye cease not, be my curse on your head&mdash;there
may ye dance for a year and a day!"</p>

<p>He banned them bitterly; with uplifted hands
and eyes he imprecated the vengeance of Heaven on
their disobedience. He prayed to the Lord to punish
them for the slight of his directions. Then he
sought his cell to vent his ire in solitude.</p>

<p>From that hour they continued to dance until a
year and a day had fully expired. Night fell, and
they ceased not; day dawned, and they danced still.
In the heat of noon, in the cool of the evening, day
after day there was no rest for them, their saltation
was without end. The seasons rolled over them.
Summer gave place to autumn, winter succeeded
summer, and spring decked the fields with early
flowers, as winter slowly disappeared, yet still they
danced on, through coursing time and changing
seasons, with unabated strength and unimpaired
energy. Rain nor hail, snow nor storm, sunshine
nor shade, seemed to affect them. Round and
round and round they danced, in heat and cold, in
damp and dry, in light and darkness. What were
the seasons&mdash;what the times or the hour or the
weather to them? In vain did their neighbours
and friends try to arrest them in their wild evolutions;
in vain were attempts made to stop them in
their whirling career; in vain did even the Abbot
himself interpose to relieve them from the curse
he had laid on them, and to put a period to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
punishment of which he had been the cause. The
strongest man in the vicinity held out his hand and
caught one of them, with the intention of arresting
his rotation, and tearing him from the charmed
circle, but his arm was torn from him in the attempt,
and clung to the dancer with the grip of life till
his day was done. The man paid his life as the
forfeit of his temerity. No effort was left untried
to relieve the dancers, but every one failed. The
sufferers themselves, however, appeared quite unconscious
of what was passing. They seemed to be
in a state of perfect somnambulism, and to be altogether
unaware of the presence of any persons, as
well as insensible to pain or fatigue. When the
expiration of their punishment arrived, they were
all found huddled together in the deep cavity which
their increasing gyrations had worn in the earth
beneath them. It was a considerable time before
sense and consciousness returned to them, and
indeed they never after could be said to enjoy them
completely, for, though they lived long, they were
little better than idiots during the remainder of their
lives.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE LITTLE SHROUD.</h2>


<p>There was once a woman who had a little son of
about seven years old, who was so lovely and beautiful
that no one could look upon him without being
kind to him, and he was dearer to her than all the
world beside. It happened that he suddenly fell ill
and died, and his mother would not be comforted,
but wept for him day and night. Shortly after he
was buried he showed himself at night in the places
where he had been used in his lifetime to sit and
play, and if his mother wept, he wept also, and when
the morning came he departed. Since his mother
never ceased weeping, the child came one night in
the little white shroud in which he had been laid in
his coffin, and with the chaplet upon his head, and
seating himself at her feet, upon the bed, he
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"O mother, mother, give over crying, else I cannot
stop in my coffin, for my shroud is never dry
because of your tears, for they fall upon it."</p>

<p>When his mother heard this she was sore afraid,
and wept no more. And the babe came upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
another night, holding in his hand a little taper, and
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, mother, my shroud is now quite dry, and
I can rest in my grave."</p>

<p>Then she bowed to the will of Providence, and
bore her sorrow with silence and patience, and the
little child returned not again, but slept in his
underground bed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE ARCH ROGUE.</h2>


<p>There once lived, years ago, a man known only by
the name of the Arch Rogue. By dint of skill in
the black art, and all arts of imposition, he drove a
more flourishing trade than all the rest of the sorcerers
of the age. It was his delight to travel from
one country to another merely to play upon mankind,
and no living soul was secure, either in house
or field, nor could properly call them his own.</p>

<p>Now his great reputation for these speedy methods
of possessing himself of others' property excited the
envy of a certain king of a certain country, who
considered them as no less than an invasion of his
royal prerogative. He could not sleep a wink for
thinking about it, and he despatched troops of
soldiers, one after another, with strict orders to
arrest him, but all their search was in vain. At
length, after long meditation, the king said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only wait a little, thou villain cutpurse, and yet
I will have thee."</p>

<p>Forthwith he issued a manifesto, stating that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
royal mercy would be extended to so light-fingered
a genius, upon condition that he consented to appear
at court and give specimens of his dexterity for his
majesty's amusement.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as the king was standing at his
palace window enjoying the fine prospect of woods
and dales, over which a tempest appeared to be
then just gathering, some one suddenly clapped him
upon the shoulder, and on looking round he discovered
a very tall, stout, dark-whiskered man close
behind him, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I am."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" inquired the king.</p>

<p>"He whom you look for."</p>

<p>The king uttered an exclamation of surprise, not
unmixed with fear, at such amazing assurance. The
stranger continued, "Don't be alarmed. Only keep
your word with me, and I will prove myself quite
obedient to your orders."</p>

<p>This being agreed on, the king acquainted his
royal consort and the whole court that the great
sleight-of-hand genius had discovered himself, and
soon, in a full assembly, his majesty proceeded to
question him, and lay on him his commands.</p>

<p>"Mark what I say," he said, "nor venture to dispute
my orders. To begin, do you see yon rustic,
not far from the wood, busy ploughing?"</p>

<p>The conjurer nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Then go," continued the king,&mdash;"go and rob him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
of his plough and oxen without his knowing anything
about it."</p>

<p>The king flattered himself that this was impossible,
for he did not conceive how the conjurer
could perform such a task in the face of open day,&mdash;and
if he fail, thought he, I have him in my power,
and will make him smart.</p>

<p>The conjurer proceeded to the spot, and as the
storm appeared to increase, the rain beginning to
pour down in torrents, the countryman, letting his
oxen rest, ran under a tree for shelter, until the
rain should have ceased. Just then he heard some
one singing in the wood. Such a glorious song he
had never heard before in all his life. He felt
wonderfully enlivened, and, as the weather continued
dull, he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm in taking a look. Yes;
I'll see what sport is stirring," and away he slipped
into the wood, still further and further, in search of
the songster.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the conjurer was not idle. He
changed places with the rustic, taking care of the
oxen while their master went searching through the
wood. Darting out of the thicket, in a few moments
he had slashed off the oxen's horns and tails, and
stuck them, half hid, in the ploughman's last furrow.
He then drove off the beasts pretty sharply towards
the palace. In a short time the rustic found his
way back, and looking towards the spot for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
oxen could see nothing of them. Searching on all
sides, he came at last to examine the furrow, and
beheld, to his horror, the horns and tails of his poor
beasts sticking out of the ground. Imagining that
a thunderbolt must have struck the beasts, and the
earth swallowed them up, he poured forth a most
dismal lamentation over his lot, roaring aloud until
the woods echoed to the sound. When he was
tired of this, he bethought him of running home to
find a pick and a spade to dig his unlucky oxen out
of the earth as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As he went he was met by the king and the conjurer,
who inquired the occasion of his piteous
lamentation.</p>

<p>"My oxen! my poor oxen!" cried the boor, and
then he related all that had happened to him,
entreating them to go with him to the place. The
conjurer said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why don't you see if you cannot pull the oxen
out again by the horns or by the tail?"</p>

<p>With this the rustic, running back, seized one of
the tails, and, pulling with all his might, it gave way
and he fell backward.</p>

<p>"Thou hast pulled thy beast's tail off," said the
conjurer. "Try if thou canst succeed better with
his horns. If not, thou must even dig them out."</p>

<p>Again the rustic tried with the same result, while
the king laughed very heartily at the sight. As the
worthy man now appeared excessively troubled at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
his misfortunes, the king promised him another pair
of oxen, and the rustic was content.</p>

<p>"You have made good your boast," said the king
to the conjurer, as they returned to the palace; "but
now you will have to deal with a more difficult
matter, so muster your wit and courage. To-night
you must steal my favourite charger out of his stable,
and let nobody know who does it."</p>

<p>Now, thought the king, I have trapped him at
last, for he will never be able to outwit my master
of the horse, and all my grooms to boot. To make
the matter sure, he ordered a strong guard under
one of his most careful officers to be placed round
the stable court. They were armed with stout
battle-axes, and were enjoined every half-hour to
give the word, and pace alternately through the
court. In the royal stables others had the like duty
to perform, while the master of the horse himself
was to ride the favourite steed the whole time,
having been presented by the king with a gold snuff-box,
from which he was to take ample pinches in
order to keep himself awake, and give signal by a
loud sneeze. He was also armed with a heavy
sword, with which he was to knock the thief on the
head if he approached.</p>

<p>The rogue first arrayed himself in the master of
the bedchamber's clothes, without his leave. About
midnight he proceeded to join the guards, furnished
with different kinds of wine, and told them that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
king had sent him to thank them for so cheerfully
complying with his orders. He also informed them
that the impostor had been already caught and
secured, and added that the king had given permission
for the guards to have a glass or two, and
requested that they would not give the word quite
so loudly, as her majesty had not been able to close
her eyes. He then marched into the stables, where
he found the master of the horse astride the royal
charger, busily taking snuff and sneezing at intervals.
The master of the bedchamber poured him out
a sparkling glass to drink to the health of his
majesty, who had sent it, and it looked too excellent
to resist. Both master and guards then began to
jest over the Arch Rogue's fate, taking, like good
subjects, repeated draughts&mdash;all to his majesty's
health. At length they began to experience their
effects. They gaped and stretched, sank gradually
upon the ground, and fell asleep. The master, by
dint of fresh pinches, was the last to yield, but he
too blinked, stopped the horse, which he had kept
at a walk, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am so confoundedly sleepy I can hold it no
longer. Take you care of the charger for a moment.
Bind him fast to the stall&mdash;and just keep watch."</p>

<p>Having uttered these words, he fell like a heavy
sack upon the floor and snored aloud. The conjurer
took his place upon the horse, gave it whip
and spur, and galloped away through the sleeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
guards, through the court gates, and whistled as he
went.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the king, eager to learn the
result, hastened to his royal mews, and was not a little
surprised to find the whole of his guards fast asleep
upon the ground, but he saw nothing of his charger.</p>

<p>"What is to do here?" he cried in a loud voice.
"Get up; rouse, you idle varlets!"</p>

<p>At last one of them, opening his eyes, cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"The king! the king!"</p>

<p>"Ay, true enough, I am here," replied his
majesty, "but my favourite horse is not. Speak,
answer on the instant."</p>

<p>While the affrighted wretches, calling one to
another, rubbed their heavy eyes, the king was
examining the stalls once more, and, stumbling over
his master of the horse, turned and gave him some
hearty cuffs about the ears. But the master only
turned upon the other side, and grumbled&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me alone, you rascal, my royal master's
horse is not for the like of you."</p>

<p>"Rascal!" exclaimed the king, "do you know who
it is?" and he was just about to call his attendants,
when he heard hasty footsteps, and the conjurer
stood before him.</p>

<p>"My liege," he said, "I have just returned from
an airing on your noble horse. He is, indeed, a fine
animal, but once or so I was obliged to give him the
switch."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
The king felt excessively vexed at the rogue's
success, but he was the more resolved to hit upon
something that should bring his fox skin into
jeopardy at last. So he thought, and the next day
he addressed the conjurer thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy third trial is now about to take place, and
if you are clever enough to carry it through, you
shall not only have your life and liberty, but a
handsome allowance to boot. In the other case you
know your fate. Now listen. This very night I
command you to rob my queen consort of her bridal
ring, to steal it from her finger, and let no one know
the thief or the way of thieving."</p>

<p>When night approached, his majesty caused all
the doors in the palace to be fast closed, and a
guard to be set at each. He himself, instead of
retiring to rest, took his station, well armed, in an
easy chair close to the queen's couch.</p>

<p>It was a moonlight night, and about two in the
morning the king plainly heard a ladder reared up
against the window, and the soft step of a man
mounting it. When the king thought the conjurer
must have reached the top, he called out from the
window&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let fall."</p>

<p>The next moment the ladder was dashed away,
and something fell with a terrible crash to the
ground. The king uttered an exclamation of alarm,
and ran down into the court, telling the queen, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
was half asleep, that he was going to see if the
conjurer were dead. But the rogue had borrowed
a dead body from the gallows, and having dressed
it in his own clothes, had placed it on the ladder.
Hardly had the king left the chamber before the
conjurer entered it and said to the queen in the
king's voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, he is stone dead, so you may now go
quietly to sleep, only hand me here your ring. It
is too costly and precious to trust it in bed while
you sleep."</p>

<p>The queen, imagining it was her royal consort,
instantly gave him the ring, and in a moment the
conjurer was off with it on his finger. Directly
afterwards the king came back.</p>

<p>"At last," he said, "I have indeed carried the
joke too far. I have repaid him. He is lying there
as dead as a door nail. He will plague us no
more."</p>

<p>"I know that already," replied the queen. "You
have told me exactly the same thing twice over."</p>

<p>"How came you to know anything about it?"
inquired his majesty.</p>

<p>"How? From yourself to be sure," replied his
consort. "You informed me that the conjurer was
dead, and then you asked me for my ring."</p>

<p>"I ask for the ring!" exclaimed the king. "Then
I suppose you must have given it to him," continued
his majesty, in a tone of great indignation;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
"and is it even so at last? By all the saints, this
is one of the most confounded, unmanageable knaves
in existence. I never knew anything to equal it."</p>

<p>Then he informed the queen of the whole affair,
though before he arrived at the conclusion of his
tale she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Soon after it was light in the morning the wily
conjurer made his appearance. He bowed to the
earth three times before the queen and presented
her with the treasure he had stolen. The king,
though excessively chagrined, could not forbear
laughing at the sight.</p>

<p>"Now hear," said he, "thou king of arch rogues.
Had I only caught a sight of you through my
fingers as you were coming, you would never have
come off so well. As it is, let what is past be forgiven
and forgotten. Take up your residence at
my court, and take care that you do not carry your
jokes too far, for in such a case I may find myself
compelled to withdraw my favour from you if
nothing worse ensue."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span></p>

<h2>BROTHER MERRY.</h2>


<p>In days of yore there was a war, and when it was
at an end a great number of the soldiers that had
been engaged in it were disbanded. Among the
rest Brother Merry received his discharge, and
nothing more for all he had done than a very little
loaf of soldier's bread, and four halfpence in money.
With these possessions he went his way. Now a
saint had seated himself in the road, like a poor
beggar man, and when Brother Merry came along,
he asked him for charity to give him something.
Then the soldier said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear beggar man, what shall such as I give
you? I have been a soldier, and have just got my
discharge, and with it only a very little loaf
and four halfpence. When that is gone I shall
have to beg like yourself."</p>

<p>However, he divided the loaf into four parts, and
gave the saint one, with a halfpenny. The saint
thanked him, and having gone a little further along
the road seated himself like another beggar in the
way of the soldier. When Brother Merry came up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
the saint again asked alms of him, and the old
soldier again gave him another quarter of the loaf
and another halfpenny.</p>

<p>The saint thanked him, and seated himself in the
way a third time, like another beggar, and again addressed
Brother Merry. Brother Merry gave him
a third quarter of the loaf, and the third halfpenny.</p>

<p>The saint thanked him, and Brother Merry journeyed
on with all he had left&mdash;one quarter of the
loaf and a single halfpenny. When he came to a
tavern, being hungry and thirsty, he went in and
ate the bread, and spent the halfpenny in beer to
drink with it. When he had finished, he continued
his journey, and the saint, in the disguise of a disbanded
soldier, met him again and saluted him.</p>

<p>"Good day, comrade," said he; "can you give me
a morsel of bread, and a halfpenny to get a drop
of drink?"</p>

<p>"Where shall I get it?" answered Brother
Merry. "I got my discharge, and nothing with it
but a loaf and four halfpence, and three beggars
met me on the road and I gave each of them a
quarter of the loaf and a halfpenny. The last
quarter I have just eaten at the tavern, and I have
spent the last halfpenny in drink. I am quite
empty now. If you have nothing, let us go begging
together."</p>

<p>"No, that will not be necessary just now," said
the saint. "I understand a little about doctoring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
and I will in time obtain as much as I need by
that."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Brother Merry, "I know nothing
about that, so I must go and beg by myself."</p>

<p>"Only come along," replied the saint, "and if I
can earn anything, you shall go halves."</p>

<p>"That will suit me excellently," replied Brother
Merry.</p>

<p>So they travelled on together.</p>

<p>They had not gone a great distance before they
came to a cottage in which they heard a great
lamenting and screaming. They went in to see
what was the matter, and found a man sick to the
death, as if about to expire, and his wife crying
and weeping loudly.</p>

<p>"Leave off whining and crying," said the saint.
"I will make the man well again quickly enough,"
and he took a salve out of his pocket and cured the
man instantly, so that he could stand up and was
quite hearty. Then the man and his wife, in great
joy, demanded&mdash;</p>

<p>"How can we repay you? What shall we give
you?"</p>

<p>The saint would not, however, take anything,
and the more the couple pressed him the more
firmly he declined. Brother Merry, who had been
looking on, came to his side, and, nudging him, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take something; take something. We want it
badly enough."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
At length the peasant brought a lamb, which
he desired the saint to accept, but he declined
it still. Then Brother Merry jogged his side, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take it, you foolish fellow; take it. We want
it badly enough."</p>

<p>At last the saint said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take the lamb, but I shall not carry
it. You must carry it."</p>

<p>"There's no great hardship in that," cried Brother
Merry. "I can easily do it;" and he took it on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>After that they went on till they came to a
wood, and Brother Merry, who was very hungry,
and found the lamb a heavy load, called out to
the saint&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hallo! here is a nice place for us to dress and
eat the lamb."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied his companion;
"but I don't understand anything of cooking, so do
you begin, and I will walk about until it is ready.
Don't begin to eat until I return. I will take care
to be back in time."</p>

<p>"Go your ways," said Brother Merry; "I can
cook it well enough. I'll soon have it ready."</p>

<p>The saint wandered away, while Brother Merry
lighted the fire, killed the lamb, put the pieces
into the pot, and boiled them. In a short time the
lamb was thoroughly done, but the saint had not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
returned; so Merry took the meat up, carved it,
and found the heart.</p>

<p>"That is the best part of it," said he; and he
kept tasting it until he had finished it.</p>

<p>At length the saint came back, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I only want the heart. All the rest you may
have, only give me that."</p>

<p>Then Brother Merry took his knife and fork, and
turned the lamb about as if he would have found
the heart, but of course he could not discover it.
At last he said, in a careless manner&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not here."</p>

<p>"Not there? Where should it be, then?" said
the saint.</p>

<p>"That I don't know," said Merry; "but now I
think of it, what a couple of fools we are to look
for the heart of a lamb. A lamb, you know, has
not got a heart."</p>

<p>"What?" said the saint; "that's news, indeed.
Why, every beast has a heart, and why should not
the lamb have one as well as the rest of them?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly, comrade, a lamb has no heart.
Only reflect, and it will occur to you that it really
has not."</p>

<p>"Well," replied his companion, "it is quite sufficient.
There is no heart there, so I need none of
the lamb. You may eat it all."</p>

<p>"Well, what I cannot eat I'll put in my knapsack,"
said Brother Merry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
Then he ate some, and disposed of the rest as he
had said. Now, as they continued their journey,
the saint contrived that a great stream should flow
right across their path, so that they must be
obliged to ford it. Then said he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go you first."</p>

<p>"No," answered Brother Merry; "go you first,"
thinking that if the water were too deep he would
stay on the bank where he was. However, the
saint waded through, and the water only reached
to his knees; but when Brother Merry ventured,
the stream seemed suddenly to increase
in depth, and he was soon up to his neck in the
water.</p>

<p>"Help me, comrade," he cried.</p>

<p>"Will you confess," said the saint, "that you ate
the lamb's heart?"</p>

<p>The soldier still denied it, and the water got still
deeper, until it reached his mouth. Then the saint
said again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you confess, then, that you ate the lamb's
heart?"</p>

<p>Brother Merry still denied what he had done,
and as the saint did not wish to let him drown he
helped him out of his danger.</p>

<p>They journeyed on until they came to a kingdom
where they heard that the king's daughter lay
dangerously ill.</p>

<p>"Holloa! brother," said the soldier, "here's a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
catch for us. If we can only cure her we shall be
made for ever."</p>

<p>The saint, however, was not quick enough for
Brother Merry.</p>

<p>"Come, Brother Heart," said the soldier, "put
your best foot forward, so that we may come in at
the right time."</p>

<p>But the saint went still slower, though his companion
kept pushing and driving him, till at last
they heard that the princess was dead.</p>

<p>"This comes of your creeping so," said the
soldier.</p>

<p>"Now be still," said the saint, "for I can do
more than make the sick whole; I can bring the
dead to life again."</p>

<p>"If that's true," said Brother Merry, "you must
at least earn half the kingdom for us."</p>

<p>At length they arrived at the king's palace,
where everybody was in great trouble, but the saint
told the king he would restore his daughter to him.
They conducted him to where she lay, and he commanded
them to let him have a caldron of water,
and when it had been brought, he ordered all the
people to go away, and let nobody remain with him
but Brother Merry. Then he divided the limbs of
the dead princess, and throwing them into the water,
lighted a fire under the caldron, and boiled them.
When all the flesh had fallen from the bones, the
saint took them, laid them on a table, and placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
them together in their natural order. Having done
this, he walked before them, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arise, thou dead one!"</p>

<p>As he repeated these words the third time the
princess arose, alive, well, and beautiful.</p>

<p>The king was greatly rejoiced, and said to the
saint&mdash;</p>

<p>"Require for thy reward what thou wilt.
Though it should be half my empire, I will give
it you."</p>

<p>But the saint replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I desire nothing for what I have done."</p>

<p>"O thou Jack Fool!" thought Brother Merry
to himself. Then, nudging his comrade's side, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be so silly. If you won't have anything,
yet I need somewhat."</p>

<p>The saint, however, would take nothing, but as
the king saw that his companion would gladly have
a gift, he commanded the keeper of his treasures to
fill his knapsack with gold, at which Brother Merry
was right pleased.</p>

<p>Again they went upon their way till they came
to a wood, when the saint said to his fellow-traveller&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we will share the gold."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the soldier, "that we can."</p>

<p>Then the saint took the gold and divided it into
three portions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
"Well," thought Brother Merry, "what whim
has he got in his head now, making three parcels,
and only two of us?"</p>

<p>"Now," said the saint, "I have divided it fairly,
one for me, and one for you, and one for him who
ate the heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ate that," said the soldier, quickly taking
up the gold. "I did, I assure you."</p>

<p>"How can that be true?" replied the saint. "A
lamb has no heart."</p>

<p>"Ay! what, brother? What are you thinking
of? A lamb has no heart? Very good! When
every beast has why should that one be without?"</p>

<p>"Now that is very good," said the saint. "Take
all the gold yourself, for I shall remain no more
with you, but will go my own way alone."</p>

<p>"As you please, Brother Heart," answered the
soldier. "A pleasant journey to you, my hearty."</p>

<p>The saint took another road, and as he went
off&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," thought the soldier, "it's all right that
he has marched off, for he is an odd fellow."</p>

<p>Brother Merry had now plenty of money, but he
did not know how to use it, so he spent it and gave
it away, till in the course of a little time he found
himself once more penniless. At last he came into
a country where he heard that the king's daughter
was dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
"Ah!" thought he, "that may turn out well.
I'll bring her to life again."</p>

<p>Then he went to the king and offered his services.
Now the king had heard that there was an old
soldier who went about restoring the dead to life,
and he thought that Brother Merry must be just
the man. However, he had not much confidence
in him, so he first consulted his council, and they
agreed that as the princess was certainly dead, the
old soldier might be allowed to see what he could
do. Brother Merry commanded them to bring him
a caldron of water, and when every one had left
the room he separated the limbs, threw them into
the caldron, and made a fire under it, exactly as
he had seen the saint do. When the water boiled
and the flesh fell from the bones, he took them and
placed them upon the table, but as he did not know
how to arrange them he piled them one upon another.
Then he stood before them, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou dead, arise!" and he cried so three times,
but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>"Stand up, you vixen! stand up, or it shall be
the worse for you," he cried.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he repeated these words ere the
saint came in at the window, in the likeness of an
old soldier, just as before, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You impious fellow! How can the dead stand
up when you have thrown the bones thus one upon
another?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
"Ah! Brother Heart," answered Merry, "I have
done it as well as I can."</p>

<p>"I will help you out of your trouble this time,"
said the saint; "but I tell you this, if you ever
again undertake a job of this kind, you will repent
it, and for this you shall neither ask for nor take
the least thing from the king."</p>

<p>Having placed the bones in their proper order,
the saint said three times&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou dead, arise!" and the princess stood up,
sound and beautiful as before. Then the saint
immediately disappeared again out of the window,
and Brother Merry was glad that all had turned out
so well. One thing, however, grieved him sorely, and
that was that he might take nothing from the king.</p>

<p>"I should like to know," thought he, "what
Brother Heart had to grumble about. What he
gives with one hand he takes with the other. There
is no wit in that."</p>

<p>The king asked Brother Merry what he would
have, but the soldier durst not take anything.
However, he managed by hints and cunning that the
king should fill his knapsack with money, and with
that he journeyed on. When he came out of the
palace door, however, he found the saint standing
there, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"See what a man you are. Have I not forbidden
you to take anything, and yet you have your knapsack
filled with gold?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
"How can I help it," answered the soldier, "if
they would thrust it in?"</p>

<p>"I tell you this," said the saint, "mind that you
don't undertake such a business a second time. If
you do, it will fare badly with you."</p>

<p>"Ah! brother," answered the soldier, "never fear.
Now I have money, why should I trouble myself
with washing bones?"</p>

<p>"That will not last a long time," said the saint;
"but, in order that you may never tread in a forbidden
path, I will bestow upon your knapsack this
power, that whatsoever you wish in it shall be there.
Farewell! you will never see me again."</p>

<p>"Adieu," said Brother Merry, and thought he,
"I am glad you are gone. You are a wonderful
fellow. I am willing enough not to follow you."</p>

<p>He forgot all about the wonderful property
bestowed upon his knapsack, and very soon he had
spent and squandered his gold as before. When he
had but fourpence left, he came to a public-house,
and thought that the money must go. So he called
for three pennyworth of wine and a pennyworth of
bread. As he ate and drank, the flavour of roasting
geese tickled his nose, and, peeping and prying
about, he saw that the landlord had placed two geese
in the oven. Then it occurred to him what his
companion had told him about his knapsack, so he
determined to put it to the test. Going out, he
stood before the door, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
"I wish that the two geese which are baking in
the oven were in my knapsack."</p>

<p>When he had said this, he peeped in, and, sure
enough, there they were.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" said he, "that is all right. I am a
made man."</p>

<p>He went on a little way, took out the geese, and
commenced to eat them. As he was thus enjoying
himself, there came by two labouring men, who
looked with hungry eyes at the one goose which was
yet untouched. Brother Merry noticed it, and
thought that one goose would be enough for him.
So he called the men, gave them the goose, and bade
them drink his health. The men thanked him, and
going to the public-house, called for wine and bread,
took out their present, and commenced to eat.
When the hostess saw what they were dining on,
she said to her goodman&mdash;</p>

<p>"Those two men are eating a goose. You had
better see if it is not one of ours out of the oven."</p>

<p>The host opened the door, and lo! the oven was
empty.</p>

<p>"O you pack of thieves!" he shouted. "This
is the way you eat geese, is it? Pay for them
directly, or I will wash you both with green hazel
juice."</p>

<p>The men said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are not thieves. We met an old soldier on
the road, and he made us a present of the goose."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
"You are not going to hoax me in that way,"
said the host. "The soldier has been here, but
went out of the door like an honest fellow. I
took care of that. You are the thieves, and you
shall pay for the geese."</p>

<p>However, as the men had no money to pay
him with, he took a stick and beat them out of
doors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Brother Merry journeyed on, he
came to a place where there was a noble castle, and
not far from it a little public-house. Into this he
went, and asked for a night's lodging, but the landlord
said that his house was full of guests, and he
could not accommodate him.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Brother Merry, "that the people
should all come to you, instead of going to that
castle."</p>

<p>"They have good reason for what they do," said
the landlord, "for whoever has attempted to spend
the night at the castle has never come back to show
how he was entertained."</p>

<p>"If others have attempted it, why shouldn't I?"
said Merry.</p>

<p>"You had better leave it alone," said the host;
"you are only thrusting your head into danger."</p>

<p>"No fear of danger," said the soldier, "only give
me the key and plenty to eat and drink."</p>

<p>The hostess gave him what he asked for, and he
went off to the castle, relished his supper, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
he found himself sleepy, laid himself down on the
floor, for there was no bed in the place. He soon
went to sleep, but in the night he was awoke by a
great noise, and when he aroused himself he discovered
nine very ugly devils dancing in a circle
which they had made around him.</p>

<p>"Dance as long as you like," said Brother Merry;
"but don't come near me."</p>

<p>But the devils came drawing nearer and nearer,
and at last they almost trod on his face with their
misshapen feet.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said he, but they behaved still worse.</p>

<p>At last he got angry, and crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Holla! I'll soon make you quiet," he caught
hold of the leg of a stool and struck about
him.</p>

<p>Nine devils against one soldier were, however,
too much, and while he laid about lustily on those
before him, those behind pulled his hair and pinched
him miserably.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, you pack of devils, now you are too
hard for me," said he; "but wait a bit. I wish all
the nine devils were in my knapsack," cried he, and
it was no sooner said than done.</p>

<p>There they were. Then Brother Merry buckled
it up close, and threw it into a corner, and as all
was now still he lay down and slept till morning,
when the landlord of the inn and the nobleman to
whom the castle belonged came to see how it had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
fared with him. When they saw him sound and
lively, they were astonished, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did the ghosts, then, do nothing to you?"</p>

<p>"Why, not exactly," said Merry; "but I have
got them all nine in my knapsack. You may dwell
quietly enough in your castle now; from henceforth
they won't trouble you."</p>

<p>The nobleman thanked him and gave him great
rewards, begging him to remain in his service, saying
that he would take care of him all the days of
his life.</p>

<p>"No," answered he; "I am used to wander and
rove about. I will again set forth."</p>

<p>He went on until he came to a smithy, into
which he went, and laying his knapsack on the
anvil, bade the smith and all his men hammer away
upon it as hard as they could. They did as they
were directed, with their largest hammers and all
their might, and the poor devils set up a piteous
howling. When the men opened the knapsack
there were eight of them dead, but one who had
been snug in a fold was still alive, and he slipped
out and ran away to his home in a twinkling.</p>

<p>After this Brother Merry wandered about the world
for a long time; but at last he grew old, and began
to think about his latter end, so he went to a hermit
who was held to be a very pious man and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am tired of roving, and will now endeavour to
go to heaven."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
"There stand two ways," said the hermit; "the
one, broad and pleasant, leads to hell; the other
is rough and narrow, and that leads to heaven."</p>

<p>"I must be a fool indeed," thought Brother Merry,
"if I go the rough and narrow road;" so he went the
broad and pleasant way till he came at last to a
great black door, and that was the door of hell.</p>

<p>He knocked, and the door-keeper opened it, and
when he saw that it was Merry he was sadly
frightened, for who should he be but the ninth devil
who had been in the knapsack, and he had thought
himself lucky, for he had escaped with nothing worse
than a black eye. He bolted the door again directly,
and running to the chief of the devils, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a fellow outside with a knapsack on
his back, but pray don't let him in, for he can get
all hell into his knapsack by wishing it. He once
got me a terribly ugly hammering in it."</p>

<p>So they called out to Brother Merry, and told
him that he must go away, for they should not let
him in.</p>

<p>"Well, if they will not have me here," thought
Merry, "I'll e'en try if I can get a lodging in heaven.
Somewhere or other I must rest."</p>

<p>So he turned about and went on till he came to
the door of heaven, and there he knocked. Now
the saint who had journeyed with Merry sat at the
door, and had charge of the entrance. Brother Merry
recognised him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
"Are you here, old acquaintance? Then things
will go better with me."</p>

<p>The saint replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to get into heaven?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, brother, let me in; I must put up
somewhere."</p>

<p>"No," said the saint; "you don't come in here."</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't let me in, take your dirty
knapsack again. I'll have nothing that can put me
in mind of you," said Merry carelessly.</p>

<p>"Give it me, then," said the saint.</p>

<p>Brother Merry handed it through the grating
into heaven, and the saint took it and hung it up
behind his chair.</p>

<p>"Now," said Brother Merry, "I wish I was in
my own knapsack."</p>

<p>Instantly he was there; and thus, being once
actually in heaven, the saint was obliged to let him
stay there.</p>

<h2>FASTRADA.</h2>


<p>By the side of the "Beautiful Doorway," leading
into the cloisters of the cathedral at Mainz, stands,
worked into the wall, a fragment of the tomb of
Fastrada, the fourth wife of the mighty monarch
Charlemagne according to some authorities, the
third according to others. Fastrada figures in the
following tradition related by the author of the
Rhyming Chronicle.</p>

<p>When the Kaiser, Karl, abode at Zurich, he
dwelt in a house called "The Hole," in front of
which he caused a pillar to be erected with a bell
on the top of it, to the end that whoever demanded
justice should have the means of announcing himself.
One day, as he sat at dinner in his house, he
heard the bell ring, and sent out his servants to
bring the claimant before him; but they could find
no one. A second and a third time the bell rang,
but no human being was still to be seen. At length
the Kaiser himself went forth, and he found a large
serpent, which had twined itself round the shaft of
the pillar, and was then in the very act of pulling
the bell rope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
"This is God's will," said the monarch. "Let
the brute be brought before me. I may deny justice
to none of God's creatures&mdash;man or beast."</p>

<p>The serpent was accordingly ushered into the
imperial presence; and the Kaiser spoke to it as he
would to one of his own kind, gravely asking what
it required. The reptile made a most courteous
reverence to Charlemagne, and signed in its dumb
way for him to follow. He did so accordingly,
accompanied by his court; and the creature led
them on to the water's edge, to the shores of the
lake, where it had its nest. Arrived there, the
Kaiser soon saw the cause of the serpent's seeking
him, for its nest, which was full of eggs, was occupied
by a hideous toad of monstrous proportions.</p>

<p>"Let the toad be flung into the fire," said the
monarch solemnly, "and let the serpent have
possession of its nest restored to it."</p>

<p>This sentence was carried at once into execution.
The toad was burnt, and the serpent placed in possession.
Charlemagne and his court then returned
to the palace.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, as the Kaiser again sat at
dinner, he was surprised at the appearance of the
serpent, which this time glided into the hall unnoticed
and unannounced.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" thought the king.</p>

<p>The reptile approached the table, and raising
itself on its tail, dropped from its mouth, into an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
empty plate which stood beside the monarch, a precious
diamond. Then, again abasing itself before
him, the crawling creature glided out of the hall as
it had entered, and was speedily lost to view. This
diamond the monarch caused to be set in a costly
chased ring of the richest gold; and he then presented
the trinket to his fair wife, the much-beloved
Fastrada.</p>

<p>Now this stone had the virtue of attraction, and
whoso received it from another, so long as they
wore it, received also the intensest love of that individual.
It was thus with Fastrada, for no sooner
did she place the ring on her finger than the attachment
of Charlemagne, great before, no longer
knew any bounds. In fact his love was more like
madness than any sane passion. But though this
talisman had full power over love, it had no power
over death; and the mighty monarch was soon to
experience that nothing may avert the fiat of destiny.</p>

<p>Charlemagne and his beloved bride returned to
Germany, and, at Ingelheim palace, Fastrada died.
The Kaiser was inconsolable. He would not listen
to the voice of friendship, and he sorrowed in silence
over the dead body of his once beautiful bride.
Even when decay had commenced, when the remains,
late so lovely, were now loathsome to look
on, he could not be induced to leave the corpse for
a moment, or to quit the chamber of death in which
it lay. The court were all astounded. They knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
not what to make of the matter. At length Turpin,
Archbishop of Rheims, approached the corpse, and
being made aware of the cause, by some supernatural
communication contrived to engage the
emperor's attention while he removed the charm.
The magic ring was found by him in the mouth of
the dead empress, concealed beneath her tongue.</p>

<p>Immediately that the talisman was removed the
spell was broken, and Charlemagne now looked on
the putrid corpse with all the natural horror and
loathing of an ordinary man. He gave orders for
its immediate interment, which were at once carried
into execution, and he then departed from Ingelheim
for the forest of the Ardennes. Arrived at
Aix-la-Chapelle, he took up his abode in the ancient
castle of Frankenstein, close by that famous city.
The esteem, however, that he had felt for Fastrada
was now transferred to the possessor of the ring,
Archbishop Turpin; and the pious ecclesiastic was
so persecuted by the emperor's affection that he
finally cast the talisman into the lake which surrounds
the castle.</p>

<p>An immediate transference of the royal liking
took place, and the monarch, thenceforth and for
ever after during his lifetime, loved Aix-la-Chapelle
as a man might love his wife. So much did he
become attached to it, that he directed that he
should be buried there; and there accordingly his
remains rest unto this day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE JEW IN THE BUSH.</h2>


<p>A faithful servant had worked hard for his
master, a thrifty farmer, for three long years, and
had been paid no wages. At last it came into the
man's head that he would not go on thus any
longer, so he went to his master and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have worked hard for you a long time, and
without pay, too. I will trust you to give me what
I ought to have for my trouble, but something I
must have, and then I must take a holiday."</p>

<p>The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his
man was simple-hearted, so he took out three
crowns, and thus gave him a crown for each year's
service. The poor fellow thought it was a great
deal of money to have, and said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should I work hard and live here on
bad fare any longer? Now that I am rich I
can travel into the wide world and make myself
merry."</p>

<p>With that he put the money into his purse, and
set out, roaming over hill and valley. As he jogged
along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so
merry.</p>

<p>"Why, what should make me down-hearted?"
replied he. "I am sound in health and rich in
purse; what should I care for? I have saved up
my three years' earnings, and have it all safe in
my pocket."</p>

<p>"How much may it come to?" said the mannikin.</p>

<p>"Three whole crowns," replied the countryman.</p>

<p>"I wish you would give them to me," said the
other. "I am very poor."</p>

<p>Then the good man pitied him, and gave him all
he had; and the dwarf said&mdash;</p>

<p>"As you have such a kind heart, I will grant you
three wishes&mdash;one for each crown,&mdash;so choose whatever
you like."</p>

<p>The countryman rejoiced at his luck, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I like many things better than money. First,
I will have a bow that will bring me down everything
I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set
every one dancing that hears me play upon it; and,
thirdly, I should like to be able to make every one
grant me whatever I ask."</p>

<p>The dwarf said he should have his three wishes,
gave him the bow and the fiddle, and went his way.</p>

<p>Our honest friend journeyed on his way too,
and if he was merry before, he was now ten times
more so. He had not gone far before he met an
old Jew. Close by them stood a tree, and on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
topmost twig sat a thrush, singing away most
joyfully.</p>

<p>"Oh what a pretty bird!" said the Jew. "I
would give a great deal of my money to have such
a one."</p>

<p>"If that's all," said the countryman, "I will
soon bring it down."</p>

<p>He took up his bow, off went his arrow, and
down fell the thrush into a bush that grew at the
foot of the tree. The Jew, when he saw that he
could have the bird, thought he would cheat the
man, so he put his money into his pocket again,
and crept into the bush to find the prize. As soon
as he had got into the middle, his companion took
up his fiddle and played away, and the Jew began
to dance and spring about, capering higher and
higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear
his clothes, till they all hung in rags about him,
and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so
that the blood ran down.</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake!" cried the Jew. "Mercy,
mercy, master! Pray stop the fiddle! What have
I done to be treated in this way?"</p>

<p>"What hast thou done? Why, thou hast shaved
many a poor soul close enough," said the other.
"Thou art only meeting thy reward;" and he
played up another tune yet merrier than the first.</p>

<p>Then the Jew began to beg and pray, and at last
he said he would give plenty of his money to be set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
free. He did not, however, come up to the musician's
price for some time, so he danced him along brisker
and brisker. The higher the Jew danced, the
higher he bid, till at last he offered a round hundred
crowns that he had in his purse, and had just
gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the
countryman saw so much money, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I agree to the bargain," and, taking the purse and
putting up his fiddle, he travelled on well pleased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Jew crept out of the bush, half
naked, and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder
how he should take his revenge and serve his late
companion some trick. At length he went to a
judge, and said that a rascal had robbed him of his
money, and beaten him soundly into the bargain,
and that this fellow carried a bow at his back, and
had a fiddle hanging round his neck. The judge sent
out his bailiffs to bring up the man whenever they
should find him. The countryman was soon caught,
and brought up to be tried.</p>

<p>The Jew began his tale, and said he had been
robbed of his money.</p>

<p>"Robbed, indeed!" said the countryman; "why,
you gave it me for playing you a tune, and teaching
you to dance."</p>

<p>The judge said that was not likely; that the
Jew, he was sure, knew better what to do with his
money; and he cut the matter short by sending
the countryman off to the gallows.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
Away he was taken, but as he stood at the foot
of the ladder, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord Judge, may it please your worship to
grant me but one boon?"</p>

<p>"Anything but thy life," replied the other.</p>

<p>"No," said he; "I do not ask my life. Only let
me play upon my fiddle for the last time."</p>

<p>The Jew cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! no! for heaven's sake don't listen
to him! don't listen to him!"</p>

<p>But the judge said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is only for this once, poor fellow! He will
soon have done."</p>

<p>The fact was he could not say no, because the
dwarf's third gift enabled the countryman to make
every one grant whatever he asked.</p>

<p>Then the Jew said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity's sake!"</p>

<p>The countryman seized his fiddle and struck up
a merry tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and
jailer were set agoing. All began capering, and no
one could hold the Jew. At the second note the
hangman let his prisoner go and danced also, and
by the time the first bar of the tune was played all
were dancing together&mdash;judge, court, Jew, and all
the people who had followed to look on. At first
the thing went merrily and joyously enough, but
when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to
be no end of either playing or dancing, all began to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
cry out and beg the countryman to leave off. He
stopped, however, not a whit the more for their
begging, till the judge not only gave him his life,
but paid him back the hundred crowns.</p>

<p>Then the countryman called the Jew, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell us now, you rogue, where you got that gold,
or I shall play on for your amusement only."</p>

<p>"I stole it," replied the Jew, before all the people.
"I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned
it fairly."</p>

<p>Then the countryman stopped his fiddling, and left
the Jew to take his place at the gallows.</p>

<h2>THE ELVES.</h2>


<p>The happy day at length arrived on which Count
Hermann von Rosenberg was married to his beloved
Catherine, a princess of the house of Gonzaca. The
event was celebrated by a magnificent banquet and
festival, and it was late before the Count and Countess
could leave their guests. The young Countess was
already asleep, and Hermann was sinking into a
slumber, when he was aroused by hearing the sounds
of soft and gentle music, and, the door of his apartment
flying open, a joyous bridal procession entered
the room. The figures engaged in this extraordinary
scene were not more than two or three spans high.
The bride and bridegroom were in the centre of the
procession, and the musicians preceded it.</p>

<p>Hermann rose up in bed, and demanded what
brought them there, and why they had aroused him,
whereupon one of the company stepped up to him,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are attendant spirits of that peaceful class
who dwell in the earth. We have dwelt for many
years beneath this thy birthplace, and have ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
watched over thy dwelling to preserve it from misfortune.
Already have we taken good care of the
ashes of your forefathers that they should not fall
into the power of hostile and evil spirits, and as
faithful servants we watch over the welfare of your
house. Since thou hast this day been married for
the continuance of thy name and ancient race, we
have represented to you this bridal ceremony, in
hopes that you will grant us full permission to keep
and celebrate this joyous festival, in return for which
we promise to serve you and your house with the
greatest readiness."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Hermann, laughing; "make
yourselves as merry in my castle as you please."</p>

<p>They thanked him, and took their departure.
Hermann could not, however, banish from his mind
this remarkable scene, and it was daybreak before
he fell asleep. In the morning his thoughts were
still occupied with it, yet he never mentioned one
word of the occurrence to his wife.</p>

<p>In the course of time the Countess presented him
with a daughter. Scarcely had Hermann received
intelligence of this event before a very diminutive old
crone entered the apartment and informed him that
the elfin bride, whom he had seen in the miniature
procession on the night of his nuptials, had given
birth to a daughter. Hermann was very friendly
to the visitor, wished all happiness to the mother
and child, and the old woman took her departure.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
The Count did not, however, mention this visit to
his wife.</p>

<p>A year afterwards, on the approach of her second
confinement, the Countess saw the elves on the
occasion of her husband receiving another of their
unexpected visits. The little people entered the
chamber in a long procession in black dresses,
carrying lights in their hands, and the little women
were clothed in white. One of these stood before
the Count holding up her apron, while an old man
thus addressed her&mdash;</p>

<p>"No more, dear Hermann, can we find a resting-place
in your castle. We must wander abroad.
We are come to take our departure from you."</p>

<p>"Wherefore will you leave my castle?" inquired
Hermann. "Have I offended you?"</p>

<p>"No, thou hast not; but we must go, for she
whom you saw as a bride on your wedding-night
lost, last evening, her life in giving birth to an heir,
who likewise perished. As a proof that we are
thankful for the kindness you have always shown
us, take a trifling proof of our power."</p>

<p>When the old man had thus spoken, he placed a
little ladder against the bed, which the old woman
who had stood by ascended. Then she opened her
apron, held it before Hermann, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grasp and take."</p>

<p>He hesitated. She repeated what she had said.
At last he did what she told him, took out of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
apron what he supposed to be a handful of sand,
and laid it in a basin which stood upon a table by
his bedside. The little woman desired him to take
another handful, and he did once more as she bade
him. Thereupon the woman descended the ladder;
and the procession, weeping and lamenting, departed
from the chamber.</p>

<p>When day broke, Hermann saw that the supposed
sand which he had taken from the apron of the
little woman was nothing less than pure and
beautiful grains of gold.</p>

<p>But what happened? On that very day he lost
his Countess in childbirth, and his new-born son.
Hermann mourned her loss so bitterly that he was
very soon laid beside her in the grave. With him
perished the house of Rosenberg.</p>

<h2>THE CONCLAVE OF CORPSES.</h2>


<p>Some three hundred years since, when the convent
of Kreutzberg was in its glory, one of the monks
who dwelt therein, wishing to ascertain something
of the hereafter of those whose bodies lay all undecayed
in the cemetery, visited it alone in the
dead of night for the purpose of prosecuting his
inquiries on that fearful subject. As he opened the
trap-door of the vault a light burst from below;
but deeming it to be only the lamp of the sacristan,
the monk drew back and awaited his departure
concealed behind the high altar. The sacristan
emerged not, however, from the opening; and the
monk, tired of waiting, approached, and finally descended
the rugged steps which led into the dreary
depths. No sooner had he set foot on the lowermost
stair, than the well-known scene underwent a
complete transformation in his eyes. He had long
been accustomed to visit the vault, and whenever
the sacristan went thither, he was almost sure to be
with him. He therefore knew every part of it as
well as he did the interior of his own narrow cell,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
and the arrangement of its contents was perfectly
familiar to his eyes. What, then, was his horror to
perceive that this arrangement, which even but that
morning had come under his observation as usual,
was altogether altered, and a new and wonderful
one substituted in its stead.</p>

<p>A dim lurid light pervaded the desolate abode of
darkness, and it just sufficed to give to his view a
sight of the most singular description.</p>

<p>On each side of him the dead but imperishable
bodies of the long-buried brothers of the convent
sat erect in their lidless coffins, their cold, starry
eyes glaring at him with lifeless rigidity, their
withered fingers locked together on their breasts,
their stiffened limbs motionless and still. It was a
sight to petrify the stoutest heart; and the monk's
quailed before it, though he was a philosopher, and
a sceptic to boot. At the upper end of the vault,
at a rude table formed of a decayed coffin, or something
which once served the same purpose, sat
three monks. They were the oldest corses in the
charnel-house, for the inquisitive brother knew their
faces well; and the cadaverous hue of their cheeks
seemed still more cadaverous in the dim light shed
upon them, while their hollow eyes gave forth what
looked to him like flashes of flame. A large book
lay open before one of them, and the others bent
over the rotten table as if in intense pain, or in
deep and fixed attention. No word was said; no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
sound was heard; the vault was as silent as the
grave, its awful tenants still as statues.</p>

<p>Fain would the curious monk have receded from this
horrible place; fain would he have retraced his steps
and sought again his cell; fain would he have shut
his eyes to the fearful scene; but he could not stir
from the spot, he felt rooted there; and though he
once succeeded in turning his eyes to the entrance
of the vault, to his infinite surprise and dismay he
could not discover where it lay, nor perceive any
possible means of exit. He stood thus for some time.
At length the aged monk at the table beckoned him
to advance. With slow tottering steps he made his
way to the group, and at length stood in front of
the table, while the other monks raised their heads
and glanced at him with a fixed, lifeless look that
froze the current of his blood. He knew not what
to do; his senses were fast forsaking him; Heaven
seemed to have deserted him for his incredulity.
In this moment of doubt and fear he bethought
him of a prayer, and as he proceeded he felt himself
becoming possessed of a confidence he had before
unknown. He looked on the book before him. It
was a large volume, bound in black, and clasped
with bands of gold, with fastenings of the same
metal. It was inscribed at the top of each page</p>

<p>"<i>Liber Obedienti&aelig;.</i>"</p>

<p>He could read no further. He then looked, first
in the eyes of him before whom it lay open, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
then in those of his fellows. He finally glanced
around the vault on the corpses who filled every
visible coffin in its dark and spacious womb. Speech
came to him, and resolution to use it. He addressed
himself to the awful beings in whose presence he
stood, in the words of one having authority with
them.</p>

<p>"<i>Pax vobis</i>," 'twas thus he spake&mdash;"Peace be to
ye."</p>

<p>"<i>Hic nulla pax</i>," replied an aged monk, in a hollow,
tremulous tone, baring his breast the while&mdash;"Here
is no peace."</p>

<p>He pointed to his bosom as he spoke, and the
monk, casting his eye upon it, beheld his heart
within surrounded by living fire, which seemed to
feed on it but not consume it. He turned away in
affright, but ceased not to prosecute his inquiries.</p>

<p>"<i>Pax vobis, in nomine Domini</i>," he spake again&mdash;"Peace
be to ye, in the name of the Lord."</p>

<p>"<i>Hic non pax</i>," the hollow and heartrending
tones of the ancient monk who sat at the right of
the table were heard to answer.</p>

<p>On glancing at the bared bosom of this hapless
being also the same sight was exhibited&mdash;the
heart surrounded by a devouring flame, but still
remaining fresh and unconsumed under its operation.
Once more the monk turned away and addressed
the aged man in the centre.</p>

<p>"<i>Pax vobis, in nomine Domini</i>," he proceeded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
At these words the being to whom they were
addressed raised his head, put forward his hand,
and closing the book with a loud clap, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak on. It is yours to ask, and mine to
answer."</p>

<p>The monk felt reassured, and his courage rose
with the occasion.</p>

<p>"Who are ye?" he inquired; "who may ye be?"</p>

<p>"We know not!" was the answer, "alas! we
know not!"</p>

<p>"We know not, we know not!" echoed in melancholy
tones the denizens of the vault.</p>

<p>"What do ye here?" pursued the querist.</p>

<p>"We await the last day, the day of the last
judgment! Alas for us! woe! woe!"</p>

<p>"Woe! woe!" resounded on all sides.</p>

<p>The monk was appalled, but still he proceeded.</p>

<p>"What did ye to deserve such doom as this?
What may your crime be that deserves such dole
and sorrow?"</p>

<p>As he asked the question the earth shook
under him, and a crowd of skeletons uprose from
a range of graves which yawned suddenly at his
feet.</p>

<p>"These are our victims," answered the old monk.
"They suffered at our hands. We suffer now, while
they are at peace; and we shall suffer."</p>

<p>"For how long?" asked the monk.</p>

<p>"For ever and ever!" was the answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
"For ever and ever, for ever and ever!" died along
the vault.</p>

<p>"May God have mercy on us!" was all the monk
could exclaim.</p>

<p>The skeletons vanished, the graves closing over
them. The aged men disappeared from his view,
the bodies fell back in their coffins, the light fled,
and the den of death was once more enveloped in
its usual darkness.</p>

<p>On the monk's revival he found himself lying at
the foot of the altar. The grey dawn of a spring
morning was visible, and he was fain to retire to his
cell as secretly as he could, for fear he should be
discovered.</p>

<p>From thenceforth he eschewed vain philosophy,
says the legend, and, devoting his time to the pursuit
of true knowledge, and the extension of the
power, greatness, and glory of the Church, died in
the odour of sanctity, and was buried in that holy
vault, where his body is still visible.</p>

<p><i>Requiescat in pace!</i></p>

<h2>LEGENDS OF RUBEZAHL, OR
NUMBER-NIP.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a glazier who was travelling
across the mountains, feeling very tired from the
heavy load of glass which he was carrying, began to
look about to discover a place where he might rest
it. Rubezahl, who had been watching for some
time, no sooner saw this than he changed himself
into a little mound, which the glazier not long afterwards
discovered in his way, and on which, well
pleased, he proposed to seat himself. But his joy
was not of long continuance, for he had not sat
there many minutes before the heap vanished from
under him so rapidly, that the poor glazier fell to
the ground with his glass, which was by the fall
smashed into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>The poor fellow arose from the ground and
looked around him, but the mound of earth on
which he had before seated himself was no longer
visible. Then he began bitterly to lament, and to
sigh with heartfelt sorrow over his untoward fate.
At length he started once more on his journey.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
Upon this Rubezahl, assuming the appearance of a
traveller, accosted him, and inquired why he so
lamented, and what was the great sorrow with which
he was afflicted. The glazier related to him the
whole affair, how that, being weary, he had seated
himself upon a mound by the wayside, how this had
suddenly overthrown him, and broken to pieces his
whole stock of glass, which was well worth eight
dollars, and how, in short, the mound itself had
suddenly disappeared. He declared that he knew
not in the least how to recover his loss and bring
the business to a good ending. The compassionate
mountain sprite comforted him, told him who he
was, and that he himself had played him the trick,
and at the same time bade him be of good cheer, for
his losses should be made good to him.</p>

<p>Upon this Rubezahl transformed himself into an
ass, and directed the glazier to sell him at the mill
which lay at the foot of the mountain, and to be
sure to make off with the purchase-money as quickly
as possible. The glazier accordingly immediately
bestrode the transformed mountain sprite, and rode
him down the mountain to the mill, where he
offered him for sale to the miller at the price of ten
dollars. The miller offered nine, and the glazier,
without further haggling, took the money and went
his way.</p>

<p>When he was gone the miller sent his newly
purchased beast to the stable, and the boy who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
charge of him immediately filled his rack with hay.
Upon this Rubezahl exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't eat hay. I eat nothing but roasted and
boiled, and that of the best."</p>

<p>The boy's hair stood on end. He flew to his
master, and related to him this wondrous tale, and
he no sooner heard it than he hastened to the stable
and there found nothing, for his ass and his nine
dollars were alike vanished.</p>

<p>But the miller was rightly served, for he had
cheated in his time many poor people, therefore
Rubezahl punished in this manner the injustice of
which he had been guilty.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the year 1512 a man of noble family, who
was a very tyrant and oppressor, had commanded
one of his vassals or peasants to carry home with his
horses and cart an oak of extraordinary magnitude,
and threatened to visit him with the heaviest disgrace
and punishment if he neglected to fulfil his
desires. The peasant saw that it was impossible
for him to execute the command of his lord, and
fled to the woods with great sorrow and lamentation.</p>

<p>There he was accosted by Rubezahl, who appeared
to him like a man, and inquired of him the cause
of his so great sorrow and affliction. Upon this the
peasant related to him all the circumstances of the
case. When Rubezahl heard it he bade him be of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
good cheer and care not, but go home to his house
again, as he himself would soon transport the oak,
as his lord required, into his courtyard.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the peasant got well home again
before Rubezahl took the monstrous oak-tree, with
its thick and sturdy boughs, and hurled it into the
courtyard of the nobleman, and with its huge stem,
and its many thick branches, so choked and blocked
up the entrance that no one could get either in or
out. And because the oak proved harder than their
iron tools, and could in no manner or wise, and
with no power which they could apply to it, be
hewn or cut in pieces, the nobleman was compelled
to break through the walls in another part of the
courtyard, and have a new doorway made, which
was only done with great labour and expense.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Once upon a time Rubezahl made, from what
materials is not known, a quantity of pigs, which
he drove to the neighbouring market and sold to
a peasant, with a caution that the purchaser should
not drive them through any water.</p>

<p>Now, what happened? Why these same swine
having chanced to get sadly covered with mire, what
must the peasant do, but drive them to the river,
which they had no sooner entered than the pigs
suddenly became wisps of straw, and were carried
away by the stream. The purchaser was, moreover,
obliged to put up with the loss, for he could neither
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
find his pigs again, nor could he discover the person
from whom he had bought them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Rubezahl once betook himself to the Hirschberg,
which is in the neighbourhood of his forest haunts,
and there offered his services as a woodcutter to one
of the townsmen, asking for his remuneration nothing
more than a bundle of wood. This the man promised
him, accepting his offer, and pointed out some
cart-loads, intending to give him some assistance. To
this offer of help in his labours Rubezahl replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. It is quite unnecessary. All that is to be
done I can very well accomplish by myself."</p>

<p>Upon this his new master made a few further
inquiries, asking him what sort of a hatchet he had
got, for he had noticed that his supposed servant
was without one.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Rubezahl, "I'll soon get a hatchet."</p>

<p>Accordingly he laid hands upon his left leg, and
pulled that and his foot and all off at the thigh, and
with it cut, as if he had been raving mad, all the
wood into small pieces of proper lengths and sizes
in about a quarter of an hour, thus proving that a
dismembered foot is a thousand times more effectual
for such purposes than the sharpest axe.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the owner (who saw plainly
that mischief was intended) kept calling upon the
wondrous woodcutter to desist and go about his
business. Rubezahl, however, kept incessantly
answering&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
"No, I won't stir from this spot until I have
hewn the wood as small as I agreed to, and have got
my wages for so doing."</p>

<p>In the midst of such quarrelling Rubezahl finished
his job, and screwed his leg on again, for while at
work he had been standing on one leg, after the
fashion of a stork. Then he gathered together
into one bundle all he had cut, placed it on his
shoulder, and started off with it towards his favourite
retreat, heedless of the tears and lamentations of
his master.</p>

<p>On this occasion Rubezahl did not appear in the
character of a sportive or mischievous spirit, but as
an avenger of injustice, for his employer had induced
a number of poor men to bring wood to his home
upon the promise of paying them wages, which,
however, he had never paid them. Rubezahl laid
at the door of each of these poor men as much of
the wood he carried away as would repay them, and
so the business was brought to a proper termination.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It once happened that a messenger vexed or
played some trick upon Rubezahl, who thereupon
revenged himself in the following manner, and so
wiped out the score.</p>

<p>The messenger, in one of his journeys over the
mountains, entered an hotel to refresh himself, and
placed his spear as usual behind the door. No
sooner had he done so than Rubezahl carried off the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
spear, transformed himself into a similar one, and
took its place.</p>

<p>When the messenger, after taking his rest, set
forth again with the spear, and had got some little
way on his journey, it began slipping about every
now and then in such a manner that the messenger
began pitching forward into the most intolerable
mire, and got himself sadly bespattered. It did this
so often that at last he could not tell for the soul of
him what had come to the spear, or why he kept
slipping forward with it instead of seizing fast hold
of the ground.</p>

<p>He looked at it longways and sideways, from
above, from underneath, but in spite of all his
attempts, no change could he discover.</p>

<p>After this inspection he went forward a little way,
when suddenly he was once more plunged into the
morass, and commenced crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woe is me! woe is me!" at his spear, which led
him into such scrapes, and did nothing to release
him from them. At length he got himself once
more to rights, and then he turned the spear the
wrong way upwards. No sooner had he done so
than he was driven backwards instead of forwards,
and so got into a worse plight than ever.</p>

<p>After this he laid the spear across his shoulder
like a pikeman, since it was no use to trail it upon
the earth, and in this fashion he started on. But
Rubezahl continued his tricks by pressing on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
messenger as though he had got a yoke on his back.
He changed the spear from one shoulder to the
other, until at last, from very weariness, he threw
away the bewitched weapon, imagining that the
Evil One must possess it, and went his way without
it.</p>

<p>He had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile,
when, looking carelessly about him, he was astounded
to find his spear by his side. He was sadly
frightened, and little knew what to make of it. At
last he boldly ventured to lay hands upon it. He
did so, and lifted it up, but he could not conceive
how he should carry it. He had no desire to trail
it any more on the ground, and the thought of
carrying it on his shoulder made him shudder. He
decided, however, to give it another trial, carrying
it in his hand. Fresh troubles now arose. The
spear weighed so heavy that he could not stir it a
foot from the spot, and though he tried first one
hand and then another, all his efforts were in vain.</p>

<p>At last he bethought him of riding upon the spear,
as a child bestrides a stick. A wonderful change
now came over the weapon. It ran on as though it
had been a fleet horse, and thus mounted the
messenger rode on without ceasing until he
descended the mountain and came into the city,
where he excited the wonder, delight, and laughter
of the worthy burghers.</p>

<p>Although he had endured some trouble in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
early part of his journey, the messenger thought he
had been amply compensated at the close, and he
comforted himself by making up his mind that in all
future journeys he was destined to perform he would
bestride his nimble spear. His good intentions
were, however, frustrated. Rubezahl had played his
game, and had had all the amusement he desired
with the poor knave. Accordingly he scampered
away, leaving in his place the real spear, which never
played any more tricks, but, after the old fashion of
other spears, accompanied its master in a becoming
and orderly style.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A poor woman, who got her living by gathering
herbs, once went, accompanied by her two children,
to the mountains, carrying with her a basket in
which to gather the plants, which she was in the
habit of disposing of to the apothecaries. Having
chanced to discover a large tract of land covered
with such plants as were most esteemed, she busied
herself so in filling her basket that she lost her
way, and was troubled to find out how to get back
to the path from which she had wandered. On a
sudden a man dressed like a peasant appeared before
her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, good woman, what is it you are looking
for so anxiously? and where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied she, "I am a poor woman who
has neither bit nor sup, for which reason I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
obliged to wander to gather herbs, so that I may
buy bread for myself and my hungry children. I
have lost my way, and cannot find it. I pray you,
good man, take pity on me, and lead me out of the
thicket into the right path, so that I may make the
best of my way home."</p>

<p>"Well, my good woman," replied Rubezahl, for
it was he, "make yourself happy. I will show you
the way. But what good are those roots to you?
They will be of little benefit. Throw away this
rubbish, and gather from this tree as many leaves
as will fill your basket; you will find them answer
your purpose much better."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the woman, "who would give a
penny for them? They are but common leaves, and
good for nothing."</p>

<p>"Be advised, my good woman," said Rubezahl;
"throw away those you have got, and follow me."</p>

<p>He repeated his injunction over and over again
in vain, until he got tired, for the woman would
not be persuaded. At last, he fairly laid hold of
the basket, threw the herbs out by main force, and
supplied their place with leaves from the surrounding
bushes. When he had finished, he told the
woman to go home, and led her into the right path.</p>

<p>The woman, with her children and her basket,
journeyed on some distance; but they had not gone
far before she saw some valuable herbs growing by
the wayside. No sooner did she perceive them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
than she longed to gather them, for she hoped that
she should obtain something for them, while the
leaves with which her basket was crammed were,
she thought, good for nothing. She accordingly
emptied her basket, throwing away the rubbish, as
she esteemed it, and having filled it once more with
roots, journeyed on to her dwelling at Kirschdorf.</p>

<p>As soon as she arrived at her home she cleansed
the roots she had gathered from the earth which
clung around them, tied them neatly together,
and emptied everything out of the basket. Upon
doing this, something glittering caught her eye,
and she commenced to make a careful examination
of the basket. She was surprised to discover several
ducats sticking to the wickerwork, and these were
clearly such of the leaves as remained of those
which she had so thoughtlessly thrown away on
the mountains.</p>

<p>She rejoiced at having preserved what she had,
but she was again sorely vexed that she had not
taken care of all that the mountain spirit had
gathered for her. She hastened back to the spot
where she had emptied the basket, in hopes of
finding some of the leaves there; but her search
was in vain&mdash;they had all vanished.</p>

<h2>THE HUNTER HACKELNBERG AND
THE TUT-OSEL.</h2>


<p>The Wild Huntsman, Hackelnberg, traverses the
Hartz mountains and the Thuringian forest, but he
seems mostly to prefer the Hakel, from which place
he derives his name, and especially the neighbourhood
of Dummburg. Ofttimes is he heard at night,
in rain and storm, when the moonlight is breaking
by fits and starts through the troubled sky, following
with his hounds the shadows of the wild beasts
he slew in days of yore. His retinue generally
proceed from the Dummburg, straight over the
Hakel to the now desolate village of Ammendorf.</p>

<p>He has only been seen by a few children, who,
having been born on a Sunday, had the power of
seeing spirits. Sometimes he met them as a lonely
huntsman, accompanied by one solitary hound.
Sometimes he was seen in a carriage drawn by four
horses, and followed by six dogs of the chase. But
many have heard the low bellowing of his hounds,
and the splashing of his horse's feet in the swamps
of the moor; many have heard his cry of "Hu!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
hu!" and seen his associate and forerunner&mdash;the
Tut-Osel, or Tooting Ursula.</p>

<p>Once upon a time three wanderers seated themselves
in the neighbourhood of the Dummburg.
The night was already far advanced. The moon
gleamed faintly through the chasing clouds. All
around was still. Suddenly they heard something
rush along over their heads. They looked up, and
an immense screech-owl flew before them.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried one of them, "there is the Tut-Osel!
Hackelnberg, the Wild Huntsman, is not
far off."</p>

<p>"Let us fly," exclaimed the second, "before the
spirits overtake us."</p>

<p>"We cannot fly," said the third; "but you have
nothing to fear if you do not irritate him. Lay
yourselves down upon your faces when he passes
over us. But, remember, you must not think of
addressing Hackelnberg, lest he treat you as he
treated the shepherd."</p>

<p>The wanderers laid themselves under the bushes.
Presently they heard around them the rushing by,
as it were, of a whole pack of hounds, and high in
the air above them they heard a hollow sound like
that of a hunted beast of the forest, and ever and
anon they trembled at hearing the fearful-toned
voice of the Wild Huntsman uttering his well-known
"Hu! hu!" Two of the wanderers pressed
close to the earth, but the third could not resist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
his inclination to have a peep at what was going
on. He looked up slantingly through the branches,
and saw the shadow of a huntsman pass directly
over him.</p>

<p>Suddenly all around was hushed. The wanderers
rose slowly and timidly, and looked after Hackelnberg;
but he had vanished, and did not return.</p>

<p>"But who is the Tut-Osel?" inquired the second
wanderer, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"In a distant nunnery in Thuringia," replied the
first, "there once lived a nun named Ursula, who,
even during her lifetime, tormented all the sisterhood
by her discordant voice, and oftentimes interrupted
the service of the church, for which reason
they called her Tut-Osel, or Tooting Ursula. If
matters were bad while she lived, they became far
worse when she died. At eleven o'clock every
night she now thrust her head through a hole in
the convent tower and tooted most miserably, and
every morning at about four o'clock she joined unasked
in the matin song.</p>

<p>"For a few days the sisterhood endured this
with a beating heart, and on bended knees; but on
the fourth morning, when she joined in the service,
and one of the nuns whispered tremblingly to her
neighbour&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ha! it is surely our Tut-Osel!' the song
ceased, the hair of the nuns stood on end, and they
all rushed from the church, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
"'Ha! Tut-Osel! Tut-Osel!'</p>

<p>"Despite the penances and chastisements with
which they were threatened, not one of the nuns
would enter the church again until the Tut-Osel
was banished from the walls of the nunnery. To
effect this, one of the most celebrated exorcists of
the day, a Capuchin friar, from a cloister on the
banks of the Danube, was sent for; and he succeeded,
by prayer and fasting, in banishing Ursel
in the shape of a screech-owl to the far-distant
Dummburg.</p>

<p>"Here she met Hackelnberg, the Wild Huntsman,
and found in his wood-cry, 'Hu! hu!' as
great delight as he did in her 'U! hu!' So they
now always hunt together; he glad to have a spirit
after his own kind, and she rejoiced in the extreme
to be no longer compelled to reside within the
walls of a cloister, and there listen to the echo of
her own song."</p>

<p>"So much for the Tut-Osel. Now tell us
how it fared with the shepherd who spoke to
Hackelnberg."</p>

<p>"Listen to the marvellous adventure," said the
third wanderer. "A shepherd once hearing the
Wild Huntsman journeying through the forest, encouraged
the spirit hounds, and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Good sport to you, Hackelnberg.'</p>

<p>"Hackelnberg instantly turned round and roared
out to him, in a voice like thunder&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
"'Since you have helped me to set on the hounds,
you shall have part of the spoil.'</p>

<p>"The trembling shepherd tried to hide himself,
but Hackelnberg hurled the half-consumed haunch
of a horse into the shepherd's cart with such
violence that it could scarcely be removed."</p>

<h2>THE ALRAUN.</h2>


<p>It is a well-known tradition near Magdeburg, that
when a man who is a thief by inheritance,&mdash;that is
to say, whose father and grandfather and great-grandfather
before him, three generations of his
family, have been thieves; or whose mother has
committed a theft, or been possessed with an
intense longing to steal something at the time
immediately preceding his birth; it is the tradition
that if such a man should be hanged, at the
foot of the gallows whereon his last breath was
exhaled will spring up a plant of hideous form
known as the Alraun or Gallows Mannikin. It is
an unsightly object to look at, and has broad, dark
green leaves, with a single yellow flower. The
plant, however, has great power, and whosoever is
its possessor never more knows what it is to want
money.</p>

<p>It is a feat full of the greatest danger to obtain
it. If not taken up from the root, clean out of the
soil, it is altogether valueless, and he who makes the
experiment wantonly risks his life. The moment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
the earth is struck with the spade, the bitterest
cries and shrieks burst forth from it, and while the
roots are being laid bare demons are heard to howl
in horrid concert. When the preparatory work is
done, and when the hand of the daring man is laid
on the stem to pluck forth his prize, then is it as if
all the fiends of hell were let loose upon him, such
shrieking, such howling, such clanging of chains,
such crashing of thunder, and such flashing of forked
lightning assail him on every side. If his heart
fail him but for one moment his life is forfeit.
Many a bold heart engaged in this trial has ceased
to beat under the fatal tree; many a brave man's
body has been found mangled and torn to pieces on
that accursed spot.</p>

<p>There is, however, happily, only one day in the
month, the first Friday, on which this plant appears,
and on the night of that day only may it be plucked
from its hiding-place. The way it is done is this.
Whoso seeks to win it fasts all day. At sundown
he sets forth on his fearful adventure, taking with
him a coal-black hound, which has not a single fleck
of white on its whole body, and which he has compelled
likewise to fast for four-and-twenty hours
previously. At midnight he takes his stand under
the gallows, and there stuffs his ears with wool or
wax, so that he may hear nothing. As the dread
hour arrives, he stoops down and makes three
crosses over the Alraun, and then commences to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
dig for the roots in a perfect circle around it.
When he has laid it entirely bare, so that it only
holds to the ground by the points of its roots, he
calls the hound to him, and ties the plant to its tail.
He then shows the dog some meat, which he flings
to a short distance from the spot. Ravenous with
hunger, the hound springs after it, dragging the
plant up by the root, but before he can reach the
tempting morsel he is struck dead as by some
invisible hand.</p>

<p>The adventurer, who all the while stood by the
plant to aid in its uprooting should the strength of
the animal prove insufficient, then rushes forward,
and, detaching it from the body of the dead hound,
grasps it firmly in both hands. He then wraps it
up carefully in a silken cloth, first, however, washing
it well in red wine, and then bears it homeward.
The hound is buried in the spot whence the Alraun
has been extracted.</p>

<p>On reaching home the man deposits his treasure
in a strong chest, with three locks, and only visits
it every first Friday in the month, or, rather, after
the new moon. On these occasions he again washes
it with red wine, and enfolds it afresh in a clean
silken cloth of white and red colours.</p>

<p>If he has any question to ask, or any request to
make, he then puts the one or proffers the other.
If he wish to know of things in the future, the
Alraun will tell him truly, but he will only get one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
answer in the moon, and nothing else will be done
for him by the plant. If he desire to obtain some
substantial favour, he has it performed for him on
making his request, but then the Alraun will answer
no inquiries as to the future until the next day of
visitation shall arrive.</p>

<p>Whoso has this wonder of the world in his possession
can never take harm from his foes, and
never sustain any loss. If he be poor, he at once
becomes rich. If his marriage be unblest by offspring,
he at once has children.</p>

<p>If a piece of gold be laid beside the Alraun at
night, it is found to be doubled in the morning, and
so on for any sum whatsoever, but never has it been
known to be increased more than two pieces for
each one.</p>

<p>On the demise of the owner only a youngest son
can inherit the Alraun. To inherit it effectually he
must place a loaf of white bread and a piece of
money in the coffin of his father, to be buried along
with his corpse. If he fail to do so, then is the possession,
like many others of great name in the
world, of no value to him. Should, however, the
youngest son fail before the father, then the Alraun
rightfully belongs to the eldest, but he must also
place bread and money in the coffin of his brother,
as well as in that of his father, to inherit it to any
purpose.</p>

<h2>THE GOOSE-GIRL.</h2>


<p>The king of a great land died, and left his queen
to take care of their only child. This child was a
daughter, who was very beautiful, and her mother
loved her dearly and was very kind to her. When
she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived
a great way off; and as the time drew near for her
to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey
to his country. The queen, her mother, packed up
a great many costly things&mdash;jewels, gold and silver
trinkets, fine dresses, and, in short, everything that
became a royal bride. She gave her a waiting-maid
to ride with her and give her into the bridegroom's
hands, and each had a horse for the journey. The
princess' horse was called Falada, and could speak.</p>

<p>When the time came for them to set out, the
aged mother went into the princess's bedchamber,
took a knife, and having cut her finger till it bled,
let three drops of the blood fall upon a handkerchief,
and gave it to the princess, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take care of it, dear child, for it is a charm
that may be of use to you on the road."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
They all took a sorrowful leave of the princess,
and she put the handkerchief into her bosom, got
upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her
bridegroom's kingdom.</p>

<p>One day as they were riding along by a brook,
the princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to
her maid&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my
golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to
drink."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the maid, "if you are thirsty, get off
yourself and stoop down by the water and drink.
I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer."</p>

<p>The princess got down, and knelt over the brook
and drank, for she was frightened, and dared not
bring out her cup; and she wept, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas! what will become of me?"</p>

<p>The three drops of blood answered her, and
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The princess was very gentle and meek, so she
said nothing to her maid's ill-behaviour, but got
upon her horse again.</p>

<p>They all rode further on their journey, till the
day grew so warm and the sun so scorching that
the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at
last, when they came to a river, she forgot her
maid's rude speech, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
"Pray get down, and fetch me some water to
drink in my cup."</p>

<p>But the maid answered her, and even spoke more
haughtily than before&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid."</p>

<p>Then the princess got off her horse, and lay down,
and held her head over the running stream, and
cried and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What will become of me?"</p>

<p>And the drops of blood answered her again as
before. As the princess leaned down to drink, the
handkerchief on which was the blood fell from her
bosom and floated away on the water, but the
princess was so frightened that she did not notice
it. Her maid, however, saw it, and was very glad,
for she knew the charm, and she saw that the poor
bride would be in her power now that she had lost
the drops of blood. So when the bride had done
drinking, and would have got upon Falada again,
the maid said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will ride upon Falada, and you may have my
horse instead;" so the princess was forced to give
up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her
royal clothes and put on her maid's shabby ones.</p>

<p>At last, as they drew near the end of their journey,
this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress
if she ever told any one what had happened;
but Falada saw it all, and marked it well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, while
the real bride rode upon the other horse, and
they went on in this way until they came at last to
the royal court. There was great joy at their
coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and
lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the
one who was to be his wife. She was led upstairs
to the royal chamber, but the true princess was told
to stay in the court below.</p>

<p>Now the old king happened just then to have
nothing else to do, so he was amusing himself by
sitting at his window looking at what was going on,
and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked
very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he
went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who
it was she had brought with her that was thus left
standing in the court below.</p>

<p>"I brought her with me for the sake of her
company on the road," replied she. "Pray give
the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle."</p>

<p>The king could not for some time think of any
work for her to do, but at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have a lad who takes care of my geese, she
may go and help him."</p>

<p>Now the name of this lad, whom the princess was
to help in watching the king's geese, was Conrad.</p>

<p>The false bride said to the prince&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness."</p>

<p>"That I will," said the prince.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
"Then tell one of your knackers to cut off the
head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very
unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road."</p>

<p>In reality she was very much afraid lest Falada
should some day or other speak, and tell all that
she had done to the princess. She carried her point,
and the faithful Falada was killed. When the true
princess heard of it she wept, and begged the man
to nail up Falada's head over a large dark gate of
the city, through which she had to pass every
morning and evening, that there she might see him
sometimes. The slaughterer said he would do as
she wished, and he cut off the head, and nailed it up
under the dark gate.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, as the princess and
Conrad went through the gate, she said sorrowfully&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The head answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bride, bride, there thou goest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly, sadly would she rue it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese
on. When they were come to a meadow she sat
down upon a bank there, and let down her waving
locks of hair, which were like pure gold; and when
Conrad saw it he ran up, and would have pulled
some of the locks out, but the princess cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Blow, breezes, blow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Conrad's hat go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow, breezes, blow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him after it go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er hills, dales, and rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away be it whirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my golden locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all combed and curled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there came a wind so strong that it blew
off Conrad's hat. Away it flew over the hills, and
he was forced to turn and run after it, so that when
he came back she had done combing and curling her
hair, and had put it up again safely, and he could not
get any of it. He was very angry and sulky, and
would not speak to her; but they watched the geese
until it grew dark, and then drove them homewards.</p>

<p>The next morning, as they were going through
the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada's
head, and cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bride, bride, there thou goest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly, sadly would she rue it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again
in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as
before, and Conrad ran up to her, and wanted to
take hold of it. The princess repeated the words
she had used the day before, when the wind came
and blew away his hat, and off it flew a great way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
over the hills and far away, so that he had to run
after it. When he returned, she had bound up her
hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the
geese until it grew dark.</p>

<p>In the evening, after they came home, Conrad
went to the old king and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I won't have that strange girl to help me to
keep the geese any longer."</p>

<p>"Why?" said the king.</p>

<p>"Because instead of doing any good she does
nothing but tease me all day long."</p>

<p>Then the king made him tell what had happened,
and Conrad said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we go in the morning through the dark
gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with
the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and
the head answers her."</p>

<p>And Conrad went on telling the king what had
happened in the meadow where the geese fed; how
his hat was blown away, and how he was forced to
run after it and leave his flock of geese to themselves.
The old king told the boy to go out again
the next day, and when morning came he placed
himself behind the dark gate, and heard how the
princess spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered.
Then he went into the field and hid himself in a
bush by the meadow's side, and he soon saw with
his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese, and
how, after a little time, she let down her hair that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
glittered in the sun. Then he heard her call the
wind, and soon there came a gust that carried away
Conrad's hat, and away he went after it, while the
girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this
the old king saw; so he went home without having
been observed, and when the goose-girl came back in
the evening, he called her aside and asked her why
she did so. She burst into tears, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"That I must not tell you nor any man, or I
shall lose my life."</p>

<p>The old king begged hard, but she would tell him
nothing. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you will not tell me thy story, tell thy grief
to the iron stove there," and then he went away.</p>

<p>Then the princess crept into the stove, and, weeping
and lamenting, she poured forth her whole
heart, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am alone in the whole world, though I am a
king's daughter. A treacherous waiting-maid has
taken my place and compelled me to put off my
royal dress, and even taken my place with my bridegroom,
while I have to work as a goose-girl. If
my mother knew it, it would break her heart."</p>

<p>The old king, however, was standing by the stove,
listening to what the princess said, and overheard it
all. He ordered royal clothes to be put upon her,
and gazed at her in wonder, she was so beautiful.
Then he called his son, and told him that he had
only a false bride, for that she was merely the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by. The
young prince rejoiced when he saw the princess's
beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had
been, and the king ordered a great feast to be got
ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the
top of the table, with the false princess on one side
and the true one on the other; but the waiting-maid
did not recognise the princess, for her beauty was
quite dazzling.</p>

<p>When they had eaten and drunk, and were very
merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale.
So he began, and told all the story of the princess,
as if it were a tale he had heard, and he asked the
waiting-woman what she thought ought to be done
to any one who behaved so badly as the servant in
the story.</p>

<p>"Nothing better," said the false bride, "than that
she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with
sharp nails, and that two white horses should be
put to it, and should drag it from street to street
till she were dead."</p>

<p>"Thou art she," said the old king, "and as thou
hast judged thyself, so it shall be done to thee."</p>

<p>Then the young prince was married to his true
wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace
and happiness all their lives.</p>

<h2>HANS JAGENTEUFEL.</h2>


<p>It is commonly believed that if any person
is guilty of a crime for which he deserves to
lose his head, he will, if he escape punishment
during his lifetime, be condemned after his
death to wander about with his head under his
arm.</p>

<p>In the year 1644 a woman of Dresden went out
early one Sunday morning into a neighbouring
wood for the purpose of collecting acorns. In an
open space, at a spot not very far from the place
which is called the Lost Water, she heard somebody
blow a very strong blast upon a hunting-horn,
and immediately afterwards a heavy fall
succeeded, as though a large tree had fallen to the
ground. The woman was greatly alarmed, and
concealed her little bag of acorns among the
grass. Shortly afterwards the horn was blown a
second time, and on looking round she saw a man
without a head, dressed in a long grey cloak,
and riding upon a grey horse. He was booted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
and spurred, and had a bugle-horn hanging at his
back.</p>

<p>As he rode past her very quietly she regained
her courage, went on gathering the acorns, and
when evening came returned home undisturbed.</p>

<p>Nine days afterwards, the woman returned to
that spot for the purpose of again collecting the
acorns, and as she sat down by the Forsterberg,
peeling an apple, she heard behind her a voice
calling out to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you taken a whole sack of acorns and
nobody tried to punish you for doing so?"</p>

<p>"No," said she. "The foresters are very kind
to the poor, and they have done nothing to me&mdash;the
Lord have mercy on my sins!"</p>

<p>With these words she turned about, and there
stood he of the grey cloak, but this time he was
without his horse, and carried his head, which
was covered with curling brown hair, under his
arm.</p>

<p>The woman shrank from him in alarm, but the
spirit said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye do well to pray to God to forgive you your
sins, it was never my good lot to do so."</p>

<p>Thereupon he related to her how that he had
lived about one hundred and thirty years before,
and was called Hans Jagenteufel, as his father had
been before him, and how his father had often
besought him not to be too hard upon poor people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
how he had paid no regard to the advice his father
had given him, but had passed his time in drinking
and carousing, and in all manner of wickedness, for
which he was now condemned to wander about the
world as an evil spirit.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE WAITS OF BREMEN.</h2>


<p>An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a
faithful hard-working slave to him for a great many
years, but was now growing old, and every day
more and more unfit for work. His master therefore
was tired of keeping him to live at ease like a
gentleman, and so began to think of putting an end
to him. The ass, who was a shrewd hand, saw that
some mischief was in the wind, so he took himself
slily off, and began his journey towards Bremen.</p>

<p>"There," thought he to himself, "as I have a
good voice, I may chance to be chosen town
musician."</p>

<p>After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog
lying by the roadside, and panting as if very tired.</p>

<p>"What makes you pant so, my friend?" said the
ass.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the dog, "my master was going to
knock me on the head, because I am old and weak,
and can no longer make myself useful to him in
hunting, so I ran away. But what can I do to
earn my livelihood?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
"Hark ye," said the ass, "I am going to Bremen
to turn musician. Come with me, and try what
you can do in the same way."</p>

<p>The dog said he was willing, and on they went.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they saw a cat
sitting in the middle of the road, with tears in her
eyes, and making a most rueful face.</p>

<p>"Pray, my good lady," said the ass, "what's
the matter with you? You look quite out of
spirits."</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" said the cat. "How can a body be
in good spirits when one's life is in danger? Because
I am beginning to grow old, and had rather
lie at my ease before the fire than run about the
house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me,
and was going to drown me, and though I have
been lucky enough to get away from her, I know
not how I am to live."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the ass, "by all means go with us to
Bremen. You are a good night-singer, and may
make your fortune as one of the waits."</p>

<p>The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined
the party. Soon afterwards, as they were passing
by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate,
screaming out with all his might and main.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said the ass. "Upon my word, you
make a famous noise. Pray, what is all this about?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the cock, "I was just now telling
all our neighbours that we were to have fine weather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
for our washing-day; and yet my mistress and the
cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to
cut my head off to-morrow, and make broth of me
for the guests that are coming on Sunday."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said the ass. "Come with us.
Anything will be better than staying here. Besides,
who knows, if we take care to sing in tune, we may
get up a concert of our own, so come along with us."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied the cock; so they
all four went on jollily together towards Bremen.</p>

<p>They could not, however, reach the town the first
day, so when night came on they turned off the
high-road into a wood to sleep. The ass and the
dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and
the cat climbed up into the branches; while the
cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and
then, according to his custom, before he sounded his
trumpet and went to sleep, looked out on all sides
to see that everything was well. In doing this he
saw afar off something bright, and calling to his
companions, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There must be a house no great way off, for I
see a light."</p>

<p>"If that be the case," replied the ass, "we had
better change our quarters, for our lodging here is
not the best in the world."</p>

<p>"Besides," said the dog, "I should not be the
worse for a bone or two."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
"And may be," remarked the cat, "a stray mouse
will be found somewhere about the premises."</p>

<p>So they walked off together towards the spot
where the cock had seen the light; and as they
drew near, it became larger and brighter, till they
came at last to a lonely house, in which was a gang
of robbers.</p>

<p>The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched
up to the window and peeped in.</p>

<p>"Well," said the cock, "what do you see?"</p>

<p>"What do I see?" replied the ass. "Why, I see
a table spread with all kinds of good things, and
robbers sitting round it making merry."</p>

<p>"That would be a noble lodging for us," said the
cock.</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined the ass, "if we could only get
in."</p>

<p>They laid their heads together to see how they
could get the robbers out, and at last they hit upon
a plan. The ass set himself upright on his hind-legs,
with his fore-feet resting on the window; the
dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the
dog's shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon
the cat. When all were ready the cock gave the
signal, and up struck the whole band of music. The
ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the
cock crew. Then they all broke through the window
at once, and came tumbling into the room amongst
the broken glass, with a hideous clatter. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the
opening concert, had now no doubt that some
frightful hobgoblins had broken in upon them, and
scampered away as fast as they could.</p>

<p>The coast once clear, the travellers soon sat down
and despatched what the robbers had left, with as
much eagerness as if they had not hoped to eat
again for a month. As soon as they had had
enough they put out the lights, and each once
more sought out a resting-place to his liking. The
donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in
the yard; the dog stretched himself upon a mat
behind the door; the cat rolled herself up on the
hearth before the warm ashes; the cock perched
upon a beam on the top of the house; and as all
were rather tired with their journey, they soon fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>About midnight, however, when the robbers saw
from afar that the lights were out and that all was
quiet, they began to think that they had been in
too great a hurry to run away; and one of them,
who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was
going on. Finding everything still, he marched
into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a
match in order to light a candle. Espying the
glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for
live coals, and held the match to them to light it.
The cat, however, not understanding such a joke,
sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to
the back door, where the dog jumped up and bit
him in the leg. As he was crossing over the yard
the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been
awakened by the noise, crew with all his might.</p>

<p>At this the robber ran back as fast as he could
to his comrades, and told the captain that a horrid
witch had got into the house, and had scratched his
face with her long bony fingers&mdash;that a man with a
knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the
door, and stabbed him in the leg&mdash;that a black
monster stood in the yard and struck him with a
club&mdash;and that the devil sat upon the top of the
house, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Throw the rascal up here!"</p>

<p>After this the robbers never dared to go back to
the house; but the musicians were so pleased with
their quarters, that they never found their way to
Bremen, but took up their abode in the wood. And
there they live, I dare say, to this very day.</p>

<h2>THE FLAMING CASTLE.</h2>


<p>Upon a high mountain in the Tyrol there stands an
old castle, in which there burns a fire every night,
and the flashes of that fire are so large that they rise
up over the walls, and may be seen far and wide.</p>

<p>It happened once that an old woman in want of
firewood was gathering the fallen twigs and branches
upon this castle-crowned mountain, and at length
arrived at the castle door. To indulge her curiosity
she began peering about her, and at last entered, not
without difficulty, for it was all in ruins and not easily
accessible. When she reached the courtyard, there
she beheld a goodly company of nobles and ladies
seated and feasting at a huge table. There were,
likewise, plenty of servants, who waited upon them,
changing their plates, handing round the viands, and
pouring out wine for the party.</p>

<p>As she thus stood gazing upon them, there came
one of the servants, who drew her on one side, and
placed a piece of gold in the pocket of her apron,
upon which the whole scene vanished in an instant,
and the poor frightened old woman was left to find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
her way back as well as she could. However, she
got outside the courtyard, and there stood before
her a soldier with a lighted match, whose head was
not placed upon his neck, but held by him under his
arm. He immediately addressed the old woman,
and commanded her not to tell any one what she
had seen and heard upon peril of evil befalling her.</p>

<p>At length the woman reached home, full of
anguish, still keeping possession of the gold, but
telling no one whence she had obtained it. When
the magistrates, however, got wind of the affair, she
was summoned before them, but she would not speak
one word upon the subject, excusing herself by saying
that if she uttered one word respecting it great
evil would ensue to her. When, however, they
pressed her more strictly, she discovered to them all
that had happened to her in the Fiery Castle, even
to the smallest particular. In an instant, almost
before her relation was fully ended, she was carried
away, and no one could ever learn whither she fled.</p>

<p>A year or two afterwards, a young nobleman, a
knight, and one well experienced in all things, took
up his abode in those parts. In order that he might
ascertain the issue of this affair, he set out on foot
with his servant in the middle of the night on the
road to the mountain. With great difficulty they
made the ascent, and were on their way warned six
times by an unknown voice to desist from their
attempt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
They kept on, however, heedless of this caution,
and at length reached the door of the castle. There
again stood the soldier as a sentinel, and he called
out as usual&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>The nobleman, who was bold of heart, gave for
answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is I."</p>

<p>Upon this the spirit inquired further&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who art thou?"</p>

<p>This time the nobleman made no answer, but
desired his servant to hand him his sword. When
this was done, a black horseman came riding out of
the castle, against whom the nobleman would have
waged battle. The horseman, however, dragged
him up upon his horse and rode with him into the
courtyard, while the soldier chased the servant down
the mountain. The nobleman was never more seen.</p>

<h2>THE MONKS AT THE FERRY.</h2>


<p>From time immemorial a ferry has existed from
Andernach to the opposite side of the Rhine.
Formerly it was more in use than at present, there
being then a greater intercourse between the two
shores of the river, much of which might be traced
to the Convent of St. Thomas, once the most important
and flourishing nunnery on the river.</p>

<p>Close by this ferry, on the margin of the Rhine,
but elevated somewhat above the level of the water,
stands a long, roofless, ruinous building, the remains
of the castle of Friedrichstein, better known, however,
to the peasantry, and to all passengers on the
river, as the Devil's House. How it came by this
suspicious appellative there are many traditions to
explain. Some say that the Prince of Neuwied,
who erected it, so ground down his subjects for its
construction, that they unanimously gave it that
name. Others derive its popular <i>sobriquet</i> from the
godless revelries of the same prince within its walls,
and the wild deeds of his companions in wickedness;
while a third class of local historians insist upon it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
that the ruin takes its name from the congregation
of fiendish shapes which resort there on special
occasions, and the riot and rout which they create
in the roofless chambers, reeking vaults, and crumbling
corridors of the desolate edifice. It is to this
ruin, and of the adjacent ferry, that the following
legend belongs.</p>

<p>It was in the time when the celebrated Convent
of St. Thomas over Andernach existed in its pristine
magnificence, that late on an autumnal night the
ferryman from that city to the Devil's House on the
other side of the river, who lived on the edge of
the bank below the ruins of the ancient palace of
the kings of Austrasia, was accosted by a stranger,
who desired to be put across just as the man was
about to haul up his boat for the day. The stranger
seemed to be a monk, for he was closely cowled, and
gowned from head to foot in the long, dark, flowing
garb of some ascetic order.</p>

<p>"Hilloa! ferry," he shouted aloud as he approached
the shore of the river, "hilloa!"</p>

<p>"Here, ahoy! here, most reverend father!"
answered the poor ferryman. "What would ye
have with me?"</p>

<p>"I would that you ferry me across the Rhine to
yonder shore of the river," replied the monk. "I
come from the Convent of St. Thomas, and I go
afar on a weighty mission. Now, be ye quick, my
good friend, and run me over."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
"Most willingly, reverend father," said the ferryman.
"Most willingly. Step into my boat, and
I'll put you across the current in a twinkling."</p>

<p>The dark-looking monk entered the boat, and the
ferryman shoved off from the bank. They soon
reached the opposite shore. The ferryman, however,
had scarce time to give his fare a good-evening ere
he disappeared from his sight, in the direction of
the Devil's House. Pondering a little on this
strange circumstance, and inwardly thinking that
the dark monk might as well have paid him his
fare, or, at least, bade him good-night before he
took such unceremonious leave, he rowed slowly
back across the stream to his abode at Andernach.</p>

<p>"Hilloa! ferry," once more resounded from the
margin of the river as he approached, "hilloa!"</p>

<p>"Here, ahoy!" responded the ferryman, but
with some strange sensation of fear. "What would
ye?"</p>

<p>He rowed to the shore, but he could see no one
for a while, for it was now dark. As he neared the
landing-place, however, he became aware of the
presence of two monks, garbed exactly like his
late passenger, standing together, concealed by the
shadow of the massive ruins.</p>

<p>"Here! here!" they cried.</p>

<p>"We would ye would ferry us over to yonder
shore of the river," said the foremost of the twain.
"We go afar on a weighty errand from the Convent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
of St. Thomas, and we must onwards this night.
So be up quick, friend, and run us over soon."</p>

<p>"Step in, then," said the ferryman, not over
courteously, for he remembered the trick played on
him by their predecessor.</p>

<p>They entered the boat, and the ferryman put off.
Just as the prow of the boat touched the opposite
bank of the river, both sprang ashore, and disappeared
at once from his view, like him who had
gone before them.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the ferryman, "if they call that
doing good, or acting honestly, to cheat a hard-working
poor fellow out of the reward of his
labour, I do not know what bad means, or what it
is to act knavishly."</p>

<p>He waited a little while to see if they would
return to pay him, but finding that they failed to
do so, he put across once more to his home at
Andernach.</p>

<p>"Hilloa! ferry," again hailed a voice from the
shore to which he was making, "hilloa!"</p>

<p>The ferryman made no reply to this suspicious
hail, but pushed off his boat from the landing-place,
fully resolved in his own mind to have nothing to
do with any more such black cattle that night.</p>

<p>"Hilloa! ferry," was again repeated in a sterner
voice. "Art dead or asleep?"</p>

<p>"Here, ahoy!" cried the ferryman. "What
would ye?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
He had thought of passing downwards to the
other extremity of the town, and there mooring his
barque below the place she usually lay in, lest any
other monks might feel disposed to make him their
slave without offering any recompense. He had,
however, scarcely entertained the idea, when three
black-robed men, clothed as the former, in long,
flowing garments, but more closely cowled, if
possible, than they, stood on the very edge of the
stream, and beckoned him to them. It was in vain
for him to try to evade them, and as if to render
any effort to that effect more nugatory, the moon
broke forth from the thick clouds, and lit up the
scene all around with a radiance like day.</p>

<p>"Step in, holy fathers! step in! quick!" said he,
in a gruff voice, after they had told him the same
tale in the very same words as the three others had
used who had passed previously.</p>

<p>They entered the boat, and again the ferryman
pushed off. They had reached the centre of the
stream, when he bethought him that it was then a
good time to talk of his fee, and he resolved to have
it, if possible, ere they could escape him.</p>

<p>"But what do you mean to give me for my
trouble, holy fathers?" he inquired. "Nothing for
nothing, ye know."</p>

<p>"We shall give you all that we have to bestow,"
replied one of the monks. "Won't that suffice?"</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the ferryman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
"Nothing," said the monk who had answered him
first.</p>

<p>"But our blessing," interposed the second monk.</p>

<p>"Blessing! bah! That won't do. I can't eat
blessings!" responded the grumbling ferryman.</p>

<p>"Heaven will pay you," said the third monk.</p>

<p>"That won't do either," answered the enraged
ferryman. "I'll put back again to Andernach!"</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the monks.</p>

<p>The ferryman put about the head of his boat, and
began to row back towards Andernach, as he had
threatened. He had, however, scarcely made three
strokes of his oars, when a high wind sprang up
and the waters began to rise and rage and foam,
like the billows of a storm-vexed sea. Soon a
hurricane of the most fearful kind followed, and
swept over the chafing face of the stream. In his
forty years' experience of the river, the ferryman
had never before beheld such a tempest&mdash;so dreadful
and so sudden. He gave himself up for lost, threw
down his oars, and flung himself on his knees,
praying to Heaven for mercy. At that moment two
of the dark-robed monks seized the oars which he
had abandoned, while the third wrenched one of the
thwarts of the boat from its place in the centre.
All three then began to belabour the wretched man
with all their might and main, until at length he
lay senseless and without motion at the bottom of
the boat. The barque, which was now veered about,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
bore them rapidly towards their original destination.
The only words that passed on the occasion were an
exclamation of the first monk who struck the ferryman
down.</p>

<p>"Steer your boat aright, friend," he cried, "if you
value your life, and leave off your prating. What
have you to do with Heaven, or Heaven with you?"</p>

<p>When the poor ferryman recovered his senses,
day had long dawned, and he was lying alone at the
bottom of his boat. He found that he had drifted
below Hammerstein, close to the shore of the right
bank of the river. He could discover no trace of
his companions. With much difficulty he rowed up
the river, and reached the shore.</p>

<p>He learned afterwards from a gossiping neighbour,
that, as the man returned from Neuwied late that
night, or rather early the next morning, he met,
just emerging from the Devil's House, a large black
chariot running on three huge wheels, drawn by four
horses without heads. In that vehicle he saw six
monks seated <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, apparently enjoying their
morning ride. The driver, a curious-looking carl,
with a singularly long nose, took, he said, the road
along the edge of the river, and continued lashing
his three coal-black, headless steeds at a tremendous
rate, until a sharp turn hid them from the man's
view.</p>

<h2>DOCTOR ALL-WISE.</h2>


<p>There was a poor peasant, named Crab, who once
drove two oxen, with a load of wood, into the city,
and there sold it for two dollars to a doctor. The
doctor counted out the money to him as he sat at
dinner, and the peasant, seeing how well he fared,
yearned to live like him, and would needs be a
doctor too. He stood a little while in thought, and
at last asked if he could not become a doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the doctor, "that may be easily
managed. In the first place you must purchase an
A, B, C book, only taking care that it is one that
has got in the front of it a picture of a cock crowing.
Then sell your cart and oxen, and buy with the
money clothes, and all the other things needful.
Thirdly, and lastly, have a sign painted with the
words, 'I am Doctor All-Wise,' and have it nailed
up before the door of your house."</p>

<p>The peasant did exactly as he had been told; and
after he had doctored a little while, it chanced that
a certain nobleman was robbed of a large sum of
money. Some one told him that there lived in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
village hard by a Doctor All-Wise, who was sure to
be able to tell him where his money had gone. The
nobleman at once ordered his carriage to be got
ready and rode into the city, and having come to
the doctor, asked him if he was Dr. All-Wise.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," answered he, "I am Doctor All-Wise,
sure enough."</p>

<p>"Will you go with me, then," said the nobleman,
"and get me back my money?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I will," said the doctor; "but my
wife Grethel must go with me."</p>

<p>The nobleman was pleased to hear this, made
them both get into the carriage with him, and away
they all rode together. When they arrived at the
nobleman's house dinner was already prepared, and
he desired the doctor to sit down with him.</p>

<p>"My wife Grethel, too," said the doctor.</p>

<p>As soon as the first servant brought in the first
dish, which was some great delicacy, the doctor
nudged his wife, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grethel, that is the first," meaning the first
dish.</p>

<p>The servant overheard his remark, and thought
he meant to say he was the first thief, which was
actually the case, so he was sore troubled, and said
to his comrades&mdash;</p>

<p>"The doctor knows everything. Things will
certainly fall out ill, for he said I was the first
thief."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
The second servant would not believe what he
said, but at last he was obliged, for when he
carried the second dish into the room, the doctor
remarked to his wife&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grethel, that is the second."</p>

<p>The second servant was now as much frightened
as the first, and was pleased to leave the apartment.
The third served no better, for the doctor said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grethel, that is the third."</p>

<p>Now the fourth carried in a dish which had a
cover on it, and the nobleman desired the doctor
to show his skill by guessing what was under the
cover. Now it was a crab. The doctor looked at
the dish, and then at the cover, and could not at
all divine what they contained, nor how to get out
of the scrape. At length he said, half to himself
and half aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas! poor crab!"</p>

<p>When the nobleman heard this, he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have guessed it, and now I am sure you
will know where my money is."</p>

<p>The servant was greatly troubled at this, and he
winked to the doctor to follow him out of the
room, and no sooner did he do so than the whole
four who had stolen the gold stood before him,
and said that they would give it up instantly, and
give him a good sum to boot, provided he would
not betray them, for if he did their necks would pay
for it. The doctor promised, and they conducted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
him to the place where the gold lay concealed. The
doctor was well pleased to see it, and went back to
the nobleman, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, I will now search in my book and
discover where the money is."</p>

<p>Now the fifth servant had crept into an oven to
hear what the doctor said. He sat for some time
turning over the leaves of his A, B, C book, looking
for the picture of the crowing cock, and as he did
not find it readily, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know you are in here, and you must come
out."</p>

<p>Then the man in the oven, thinking the doctor
spoke of him, jumped out in a great fright, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man knows everything."</p>

<p>Then Doctor All-Wise showed the nobleman
where the gold was hidden, but he said nothing as
to who stole it. So he received a great reward
from all parties, and became a very famous man.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE MAIDEN.</h2>


<p>It is now centuries since a young noble of the
neighbourhood was hunting in the valleys which
lie behind the hills that skirt the Rhine opposite
the ancient town of St. Goar. In the heat of the
pursuit he followed the game to the foot of the
acclivity on which are seated the ruins of Thurnberg,
and there it disappeared all at once from his view. It
was the noon of a midsummer day, and the sun
shone down on him with all its strength. Despairing
of being able to find the object of his pursuit,
he determined to clamber up the steep hillside, and
seek shelter and repose in the shadow of the old
castle, or, mayhap, in one of its many crumbling chambers.
With much labour he succeeded in reaching
the summit, and there, fatigued with his toil, and
parched with a burning thirst, he flung himself on
the ground beneath one of the huge towers, some
of whose remains still rear their heads on high, and
stretched out his tired limbs in the full enjoyment
of rest.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, as he wiped the perspiration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
from his brow,&mdash;"now could I be happy indeed, if
some kind being would bring me a beaker of the
cool wine, which, they say, is ages old, down there
in the cellars of this castle."</p>

<p>He had scarce spoken the words when a most
beautiful maiden stepped forth from a cleft in the
ivy-covered ruin, bearing in one hand a huge silver
beaker of an antique form, full to the very brim of
foaming wine. In her other hand she held a large
bunch of keys of all sizes. She was clad in white
from head to foot, her hair was flaxen, her skin was
like a lily, and she had such loving eyes that they
at once won the heart of the young noble.</p>

<p>"Here," said she, handing him the beaker, "thy
wish is granted. Drink and be satisfied."</p>

<p>His heart leaped within him with joy at her condescension,
and he emptied the contents of the goblet
at a single draught. All the while she looked at
him in such a manner as to intoxicate his very soul,
so kindly and confidential were her glances. The
wine coursed through his veins like liquid fire, his
heart soon burned with love for the maiden, and
the fever of his blood was by no means appeased by
the furtive looks which ever and anon she cast upon
him. She apparently read his state of mind, and
when his passion was at its highest pitch, and all
restraint seemed put an end to by the potent effects
of love and wine, she disappeared in a moment by
the way she came. The noble rushed after her in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
the hope of detaining the fugitive, or, at least, of
catching a parting glimpse of her retreating form,
but the ivy-encircled cleft, through which she seemed
to have flitted, looked as though it had not been
disturbed for centuries, and as he tried to force his
way to the gloomy cavern below, a crowd of bats
and owls and other foul birds of evil omen, aroused
from their repose, rose upwards, and, amidst dismal
hootings and fearful cries, almost flung him backward
with the violence of their flight. He spent
the remainder of the afternoon in search of the lost
one, but without success. At the coming of night
he wended his way homeward, weary, heart-sick,
and overwhelmed with an indefinable sensation of
sadness.</p>

<p>From that day forth he was an altered man&mdash;altered
in appearance as well as in mind and in
manners. Pleasure was a stranger to his soul, and
he knew no longer what it was to enjoy peace.
Wherever he went, whatever pursuit he was engaged
in, whether in the chase, in the hall, in lady's
bower, or in chapel, his eye only saw one object&mdash;the
White Maiden. At the board she stood in
imagination always before him, offering to his
fevered lips the cool, brimming beaker; and in the
long-drawn aisles of the chapel she was ever
present, beckoning him from his devotions to partake
of the generous beverage which she still bore
in her right hand. Every matron or maiden he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
met seemed by some wondrous process to take her
shape, and even the very trees of the forest all
looked to his thought like her.</p>

<p>Thenceforward he commenced to haunt the ruins
in which she had appeared to him, still hoping to
see, once again, her for whom he felt he was dying,
and living alone in that hope. The sun scorched
him, but it was nothing to the fever that burned
within him. The rain drenched him, but he cared
not for it. Time and change and circumstance
seemed all forgotten by him, everything passed by
him unheeded. His whole existence was completely
swallowed up in one thought&mdash;the White Maiden of
the ruined castle, and that, alas! was only vexation
of spirit. A deadly fever seized him. It was a
mortal disease. Still he raved, in his delirium,
but of her. One morn a woodman, who occasionally
provided him with food, found him a corpse at the
entrance of the crevice in the wall whence the
maiden had seemed to come, and where she had
disappeared. It was long rumoured that he had
struggled bravely with death&mdash;or rather that he
could not die, because the curse was upon him&mdash;until
the maiden, garbed in white as usual, appeared
to him once more. That then he stretched forth
his hands&mdash;she stooped over him. He raised his
head&mdash;she kissed his lips&mdash;and he died.</p>

<p>The White Maiden, tradition says, has not since
been seen in the ruins of Thurnberg.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STURGEON.</h2>


<p>The Convent of Schwartz-Rheindorf was founded
in the year of our Lord 1152 by the Bishop of
Cologne, Arnold Graf von Wied, for the reception of
noble ladies alone, and was placed by him under the
strict rule of St. Benedict. The prelate, who died
in the year 1159, lies buried beneath the high altar
of the church.</p>

<p>Among the many other rights and privileges conferred
on the convent by the Bishop was the right
of fishing in the river, within certain limits above
and below the convent's territorial boundaries. This
was a most valuable right for a long period.</p>

<p>The certainty of a profitable fishing was always
heralded by the appearance of two immense sturgeon.
They came at the commencement of each year, harbingers
of good luck, and they were ever succeeded
by shoals of river fish, in such numbers as to be
absolutely inexhaustible until the expiration of the
season. Of these sturgeon the one, a huge male,
always allowed himself to be taken by the fishermen,
but the female was never captured. It was understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
by those who knew all about these matters
that on her freedom depended the fisher's success.
This good fortune lasted for centuries.</p>

<p>It was, however, remarked that as the discipline
of the convent became more and more relaxed, and
grace grew to be less and less among its inmates, the
fishing became more and more unprofitable. The
sturgeon, it is true, still made their appearance,
but they were spent and thin, and altogether unlike
those which had been wont of yore to visit the
fishing-ground of the sisterhood. The abbess and
the nuns, however, either could not or they would
not perceive the cause of the falling off in the take,
or the change in the appearance of the sturgeon, but
the common people who dwelt in the vicinity of the
convent, and especially those poor persons to whom
the river had been heretofore a source of support,
were neither slow in seeing the cause nor in publishing
the consequences to the world. Thus stood
matters: dissoluteness of life on the one hand, distress
on the other; profligacy and poverty, extravagance
and starvation, linked inseparably together.</p>

<p>It was midwinter. On the bank of the river
stood the purveyor of the convent, accompanied by
the lady abbess herself and a great number of the nuns.
They waited to watch the first haul made by the
fishermen on the New Year's morning, according to
the custom which had prevailed in the convent for
centuries. It was not usual for the river to be open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
at that time, but this year there was not a piece of
ice on its surface. The fishermen put out in their
boats, and cast their nets into the current; then,
making the circuit of the spot, they returned to the
bank and commenced to haul them in. Little
difficulty was at first experienced by them in this
operation. For several years preceding the supply
of fish had scarcely sufficed to defray the expense of
catching. It would seem, however, as if fortune
were inclined to smile on the sisterhood once more.
The nets had not been more than half drawn in
when the fishermen began to perceive that they contained
something heavier than usual. The lady
abbess and the nuns were made acquainted with the
circumstance, and they watched, in eager expectancy,
the landing of the fish. The nets were at length
with much trouble hauled on shore.</p>

<p>"Hilloa!" said the principal fisherman, an aged
man, to the purveyor of the convent, "hast thou
ever seen such monsters before? My soul! but this
will glad the hearts of the whole convent, and make
many poor folk happy, an it be but the harbinger of
a return to the old times."</p>

<p>While he spoke two immense sturgeon were
landed. The abbess and her train approached the
landing-place, and admired the strength and superior
size of the fish.</p>

<p>"It would be but folly to set one of them free,"
she partially soliloquised and partially spoke to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
purveyor. "The convent has not had such a treat
for years past, and we absolutely require some
change. I'll warrant me they will eat delightfully."</p>

<p>The purveyor, a wily Jewish-looking fellow, who
passed for an Italian, at once assented to the observations
of his mistress, and added a few remarks of his
own in support of them. Not so, however, the old
fisherman, who overheard the conversation, having
approached the abbess with the purveyor to learn
her will and pleasure as to the disposal of the fish.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, master," he interposed, in his rough
way, "not so fast, not so fast. My father fished on
this river for full fifty years, and my father's father
did the same; and fifty years have I drawn net
here too, all in the service of the noble ladies of
Schwartz-Rheindorf. Never, in that time, knew I
other than this done with these fish&mdash;the one to be
let free, the other to be given away among the poor.
I'll do nought else with them."</p>

<p>The abbess and the purveyor were but ill-pleased
to hear what the old man said.</p>

<p>"You must do as I bid you, Herman," said the
former.</p>

<p>"You must obey my lady, your mistress," echoed
the latter. "She is too good and gracious to ye."</p>

<p>"Not I," said the old man bluntly,&mdash;"not I. For
all the broad lands on the Rhine I would not have
hand, act, nor part in such a matter. Do as ye list,
but I'll be none your servant in the matter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
The old man walked away as he said these words,
and neither the entreaties of the abbess, the threats
of the purveyor, nor the interposition of some of the
nuns present could bring him back.</p>

<p>Others, however, were soon found among his companions
who were less scrupulous; and the two
fish were accordingly removed to the convent, and
consigned to the care of the cook, to be served up
for dinner that day.</p>

<p>The dinner-hour arrived&mdash;the sisterhood were all
seated at table&mdash;the servitors, marshalled by the
supple purveyor, made their appearance, bearing the
expected banquet in large covered dishes. A hasty
grace was muttered, and then every eye was turned
to the covers. The abbess had ordered the sturgeon
to be served up first.</p>

<p>"And now, sisters," she said, with a complacent
look of benignant condescension, "I hope soon to
know how you approve of our dinner. It is my
constant study to make you happy, and my efforts
are unceasing to afford you every gratification in
my power. Let us begin."</p>

<p>The covers were removed in a twinkling by the
servitors, the carvers clattered their knives and
forks impatiently; but what was the surprise of all,
when every dish as it was uncovered was found to
be empty. The wrath of the abbess rose at the
sight, and the zeal of the nuns knew no bounds in
seconding her indignation. The cook was hurriedly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
sent for. He stood before the excited sisterhood
an abject, trembling wretch, far more like one who
expected to be made a victim of himself, than one
who would voluntarily make victims of others.</p>

<p>"How is this, villain?" exclaimed the abbess,
her face reddening with rage.</p>

<p>"How's this, villain?" echoed threescore female
voices, some of them not musical.</p>

<p>"Ay, how is this, hound?" growled the purveyor.</p>

<p>"Do you mock us?" continued the abbess, as the
cook stood trembling and silent.</p>

<p>"Do you mock us?" echoed the purveyor, with
as much dignity as he could impart into his thin,
meagre figure.</p>

<p>"Speak!" said the abbess in a loud voice, while
the cook cast his eyes around as if seeking aid
against the excited throng the room contained,&mdash;"speak!"</p>

<p>Thus urged, the cook proceeded to explain&mdash;as far,
at least, as he was able. He declared that he had
cut up and cooked the sturgeon, according to the
directions he had received from the purveyor, and
that, when dinner was served up, he had sent
them up dressed in the manner that official had
directed.</p>

<p>The abbess and her nuns were much puzzled how
to explain this extraordinary occurrence, and each
busied herself in conjectures which, as usual in such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
cases, never approached the fact. At this juncture
the aged fisherman entered the room.</p>

<p>"My lady," he said to the abbess, when he learnt
what had occurred, "it is the judgment of Heaven.
Even now I saw the fish in the river. I knew them
well, and I'll swear to them if necessary. They
floated away, swimming down the stream, and I am
a much mistaken man if ever ye see them any
more."</p>

<p>The pleasurable anticipations of the day that the
sisters had entertained were completely annihilated;
but it would have been well for them if the consequences
of their avarice and gluttony had ended
with that hour. Never more did the sturgeon make
their appearance, and the part of the stream which
pertained to the convent thenceforth ceased to produce
fish of any kind whatsoever.</p>

<p>People say that the Reformation had the effect of
wooing the finny tribe back to their old haunts. At
all events, whatever may have been the cause, it is
the fact that there is not at present a less plentiful
supply in this spot than there is in any other part
of that rich river.</p>

<h2>SAINT ANDREW'S NIGHT.</h2>


<p>It is commonly believed in Germany that on St.
Andrew's night, St. Thomas' night, and Christmas
and New Year's nights, a girl has the power of
inviting and seeing her future lover. A table is to
be laid for two persons, taking care, however, that
there are no forks upon it. Whatever the lover
leaves behind him must be carefully preserved, for
he then returns to her who has it, and loves her
passionately. The article must, however, be kept
carefully concealed from his sight, for he would
otherwise remember the torture of superhuman
power exercised over him which he that night
endured, become conscious of the charms employed,
and this would lead to fatal consequences.</p>

<p>A fair maiden in Austria once sought at midnight,
after performing the necessary ceremonies, to obtain
a sight of her lover, whereupon a shoemaker appeared
having a dagger in his hand, which he threw at her
and then disappeared. She picked up the dagger
which he had thrown at her and concealed it in a
trunk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
Not long afterwards the shoemaker visited, courted,
and married her. Some years after her marriage
she chanced to go one Sunday about the hour of
vespers to the trunk in search of something that she
required for her work the next day. As she opened
the trunk her husband came to her, and would insist
on looking into it. She kept him off, until at last
he pushed her away, and there saw his long-lost
dagger. He immediately seized it, and demanded
how she obtained it, because he had lost it at a very
particular time. In her fear and alarm she had not
the power to invent any excuse, so declared the
truth, that it was the same dagger he had left
behind him the night when she had obliged him to
appear to her. Her husband hereupon grew enraged,
and said, with a terrible voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Twas you, then, that caused me that night of
dreadful misery?"</p>

<p>With that he thrust the dagger into her heart.</p>
